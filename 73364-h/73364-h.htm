<p class="dropcap">
Tutankhamon-Tutankhaton, the
envoy of Akhnaton, the king of
Egypt, brought him a marvellous
gift from the island of Crete&mdash;Dio,
the dancer, the pearl of the
Kingdom of the Seas.
</p>

<p>
He boasted that he had saved her from death:
but it was not he who saved her.  When she killed
the god-Bull in the Knossos arena to avenge her
friend Eoia who had been sacrificed to the Beast,
she was sentenced to be burned at the stake.  But
Tammuzadad, a Babylonian who loved Dio, went
to the stake in her place and Tutankhaton merely
hid her in his ship and brought her to Egypt.
</p>

<p>
Before bringing Dio to the king in the new
capital, Akhetaton, the City of the Sun, he settled her
near Thebes, or Nut-Amon, in the country house of
his distant relative Khnumhotep, formerly the chief
superintendent of the granaries of Amon's temple.
</p>

<p>
Khnumhotep's estate was enclosed by high brick
walls that formed an oblong quadrangle making it
look like a fortress.  Within it were granaries,
cattle-yards, wine-presses, hay-lofts, barns and other
buildings, vineyards and gardens divided into regular
squares: kitchen garden, orchard, flower garden,
woods of pine and other trees and a palm plantation
with three ponds, one large and two small ones.  Two
high three-storied houses, a brick one for winter
and a wooden one with a brick bottom storey for the
summer, stood facing each other on opposite sides of
the big pond.
</p>

<p>
Dio spent a couple of months in this quiet country
place resting from all that had happened to her in
Crete and learning Egyptian dances.
</p>

<p>
One afternoon, in the middle of winter, she was
lying on carpets and cushions on the flat roof of the
summer house, in a light trellised shelter supported
by a row of cedar pillars, carved, gilded and brightly
painted.  She was looking at the sun in the dark,
almost black-blue sky, so abysmally clear that it
seemed there never had been, nor ever could be, a
cloud in it.  The sun of southern winter&mdash;of winter's
summer&mdash;bright but not dazzling, warm but not
scorching, was like the smile of a child asleep.  Half
closing her eyes, she looked straight at it and the
light broke into a diamond rainbow like a tear on the
eyelashes.
</p>

<p>
"Ra the Sun, the Sun Ra&mdash;no better name than
Ra could be invented for the sun: Ra cleaves the
darkness with a sword," thought Dio.
</p>

<p>
The winter swallows cleaved the radiant darkness
of the blue with the sword of their whirring flight:
they sang to the sun, crying and shrilling with joy:
'Ra'!
</p>

<p>
Everything was good and joyous.  There was
goodness and joy in the air, pure and dry as nowhere
else in the world, giving long life to the living and
making the dead incorruptible, air so divinely light
that one breathing it for the first time felt as though
a stone which had lain on his breast all his life had
suddenly been lifted and he understood for the first
time what a joy it was to breathe.
</p>

<p>
Close by stood a monstrous tree, covered with
thorns and prickles, with dull leaden-coloured thick
joints that seemed full of poison, and a huge blood-red
flower like the open mouth of a snake.  But the
tree, too, was good: the fragrant flowers breathed
of the sweetness of paradise&mdash;the joy of Ra.
</p>

<p>
Beyond the talc-like streak of the shallow, wintry
Nile the hills of Amenti, the Eternal West, yellow
as lion's hair and honeycombed with innumerable
tombs, lay drowsy in the rosy haze of sunshine.
But even death here was good: the souls of the
departed, like bees, collect the honey of death&mdash;the
eternal life.
</p>

<p>
"And perhaps on our Mount Ida the wind is
howling, the pines creak and the snow is falling in
big flakes," thought Dio, and the blue sky seemed
to her still more blue, the bright sun still brighter;
she wanted to weep with joy and to kiss the sky,
the sun, the earth, like the faces of loved ones after
a long parting.
</p>

<p>
She was smiling at the familiar feeling: it was
not for nothing that she had felt the touch of death
as she lay on the pyre, a victim ready to be slain.
It was as though she had died then, and now another
life, a life after death had begun: a different sky,
a different sun, a different earth&mdash;alien? oh no, more
like home than her own native land.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Sick with sorrow I lie on my bed<br>
  Wise physicians are trying to heal me.<br>
  My loved one comes to my bedside,<br>
  My sister&mdash;she mocks the physicians.<br>
  Well does she know what ails me."<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
sang in an undertone a man of thirty, with a face
fine as a woman's and large sad eyes like the eyes
of a sick child; his head was shaven like that of a
priest and he was wearing a white linen robe and a
leopard's skin thrown over his shoulder.  This was
Pentaur, a former priest of Amon and the master
of the temple dancers, who was teaching Dio
Egyptian dances.
</p>

<p>
Kneeling down, he lightly touched with the tips
of his fingers the crossed strings of a tall Amon's
harp that stood on a hollow resounding box, adorned
with two rainbow-coloured sun discs and a
four-horned head of the god Ram.
</p>

<p>
The dulcet notes of the harpstrings accompanied
the voice of the singer.  He finished one song and
began another:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Each time that the door<br>
  In my sister's house opens<br>
  My sister is displeased.<br>
  I wish I were her doorkeeper,<br>
  She would then be displeased with me.<br>
  Each time that I heard her voice,<br>
  Frightened as a child I should be."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Is that all?" Dio asked with a smile.
</p>

<p>
"That's all," said Pentaur, flushing slightly as
though ashamed of his song being too short.  He
flushed often and easily like a little boy; it was
strange and almost absurd in a man of thirty, but
Dio liked it.
</p>

<p>
"Frightened as a child I should be," she repeated,
this time without a smile.  "Yes, hardly anything is
said and yet all is said.  With you in Egypt love is
wordless, just as the sky is cloudless...."
</p>

<p>
"No, we have longer songs, too, but I don't like
them so well; the short ones are better."
</p>

<p>
He struck the strings and sang:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "I long for you more<br>
  Than a starving man longs for bread,<br>
  Than a sick one longs for health,<br>
  Than a woman in travail for the baby's cry."<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
The strings sobbed passionately, almost brutally, as
men sob with hunger, thirst, or pain.  And all of a
sudden came a subtle, cunning tune:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "I love truth, of flattery I scorn to think<br>
  I would rather see you than eat and drink."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Love compared to eating and drinking," she said
in surprise and she pondered.  "How coarse&mdash;coarse
and tender at the same time!  But of course that is
the very subtlest flattery."
</p>

<p>
"Why flattery?"
</p>

<p>
"Why?  Ah, my dear brother, that is just what is
so bitter in life, that without bread and water men
die, but without love they live."
</p>

<p>
"No, they die, too," he said quietly, and was going
to add something, but merely gazed at her in silence
and his eyes looked sadder than ever.  He blushed
and hastened to change the subject.
</p>

<p>
"I must send the pleater to you: the feathers don't
lie properly."
</p>

<p>
He put out his hand to straighten the tiny
pleats&mdash;'feathers'&mdash;on her sleeve.  Dio took his hand; he
tried to draw it away, but she kept it in hers almost
by force, roughly and tenderly at the same time,
looking into his eyes with a smile.  He turned away
and this time, instead of turning red, he turned
slightly pale under his bronze-coloured skin,
frightened as a child.
</p>

<p>
This happened at every meeting: her charm,
always new, seemed to him a miracle.  Oh, this body,
much too slender, the narrow hips, the angular
movements, the rebellious curls of bluish-black hair cut
much too short, the colour in the cheeks, dark-skinned
like a boy's and girlishly tender, the colour
of the rosy almond blossom in the gathering dusk,
and the darkish down on the upper lip&mdash;an absurd
little moustache!  A girl who was like a boy.  This
was always so; but it was new that all of a sudden
the girl did not want to be a boy.
</p>

<p>
She let his hand go, blushed and spoke of
something different.
</p>

<p>
"It is not the pleater's fault, it is simply that I do
not know how to wear these clothes&mdash;one can see
at once I am not an Egyptian."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, but it is not the dress&mdash;it's your face and
hair."
</p>

<p>
Dio did not wear a wig or plait her hair in small
tight plaits as was the custom in Egypt.
</p>

<p>
"And Tuta ... Tutankhaton says that the bell
suits me better."
</p>

<p>
"The bell" was the Cretan women's skirt, widening
towards the hem.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no!  In our dress you are still more..." he
broke off; he wanted to say 'still more like a sister'
and dared not: in Egyptian 'sister' also meant
'beloved.'
</p>

<p>
"Still more beautiful," he added with cold politeness.
They were not speaking their thoughts; both
were thinking of what was important and speaking
of trifles, as often happens when one is already in
love and the other does not yet know her mind.
</p>

<p>
Dio remembered the vow of the virgin priestesses
of the Mount Dicte goddess:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "I would rather choose the halter<br>
  Than the hateful marriage bed."<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
A man's love was still as hateful to her as the hot
sun to the flowers under water.  But it was the same
with love as with everything else: she had died and
another life had begun, another love&mdash;love through
death, like sunlight through water, having no terrors
for the flowers in the depths; or like this winter
sun&mdash;the smile of a child asleep.
</p>

<p>
"When are you going?" he asked about the most
important thing as though it were a trifle.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know.  Tuta hurries me, but I am quite
happy here."  She looked at him with a smile and
again the boy disappeared and only the girl remained.
</p>

<p>
"I am happy with you," she added so low that he
need not have heard.
</p>

<p>
"You will go away and we shall never meet again,"
he said, looking down as though he had not heard.
</p>

<p>
"My timid, absurd little boy&mdash;the winter's sun!"
she thought with gay tenderness and said:
</p>

<p>
"Why never?  Akhetaton is not far from Thebes."
</p>

<p>
"No, <i>his</i> city is the other world for us."
</p>

<p>
<i>His</i>&mdash;King Akhnaton's, she understood.
</p>

<p>
"And you don't want to go to the next world&mdash;not
even with me?" she asked, with provocative slyness.
</p>

<p>
"Why do you talk like this, Dio?  You know I
cannot..."
</p>

<p>
He broke off, but she understood again: "I cannot
relinquish the faith of my forefathers; step over my
father's blood."  She knew that his father, an old
priest of Amon, was killed in a popular rising against
the new god Aton.
</p>

<p>
Tears trembled in his voice when he said 'I cannot,'
but he controlled himself and said calmly.
</p>

<p>
"Do not go out to-day."
</p>

<p>
"Why?"
</p>

<p>
He answered after a pause:
</p>

<p>
"Maybe there will be a riot."
</p>

<p>
"Come, come, riot in a country like yours!" she
laughed.  "You Egyptians are the most peaceable
people on earth!"
</p>

<p>
She looked at him as though he were a little boy
and said: "And you, too, will go rioting?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I will," he spoke as calmly as before, but
there was a light in his eyes that made her think once
more of his father's having been killed in a riot.
</p>

<p>
"No, don't go, dear!" she begged with sudden
anxiety.
</p>

<p>
He made no answer and began singing again in
a low voice, lightly touching the strings.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Death is now to me like sweetest myrrh,<br>
  Death is now to me like healing,<br>
  Death is now to me like refreshing rain,<br>
  Death is now to me like a home to an exile,"<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Aïe-aïe-aïe!  What is it?" cried a little girl who
was sleeping in the shelter.
</p>

<p>
A little tame monkey was sitting at the top of the
tree eating yellow pods.  It threw the skins into the
shelter trying to hit the little girl or the tame gazelle
asleep at her feet.  It missed its aim every time.  At
last, hanging on to a branch with one paw, it threw
with another a handful of skins, hitting the gazelle.
The animal jumped up, and bleating ran to the
girl and licked her face.
</p>

<p>
The girl jumped up, too, and shouted in a fright.
</p>

<p>
"Aïe-aïe-aïe!  What is it?"
</p>

<p>
She was about thirteen years old.  Her brown
bronze-coloured body, slender and supple like a snake,
showed through the transparent web of her dress
'the woven air.'  She was a strange mixture of
woman and child; the rosy-bronzed nipples of her
breasts, firm and round like a grown girl's, lifted
the linen as though they would pierce it, but there
was something childishly mischievous in the eyes
and childishly piteous in the thick, pouting lips.  Her
face&mdash;ugly, charming and dangerous like a serpent's
head&mdash;seemed tiny under the mass of dull-black
fluffy hair, powdered with blue.
</p>

<p>
Miruit was one of Pentaur's best pupils; he was
training Dio to imitate her.  She threw back her
arms, stretched and yawned sweetly, still failing to
understand what had happened.  Suddenly a handful
of pods fell at her feet.  She looked up and understood.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, you bare-back devil!" she cried, and seizing
an earthenware jug from which she had drunk
pomegranate wine at dinner&mdash;that was why she had slept
so soundly&mdash;threw it at the monkey.
</p>

<p>
The animal hissed maliciously and, snapping its
teeth, jumped on to another palm tree and hid itself;
only a dry rustle among the leaves betrayed its
presence.
</p>

<p>
"It is too bad!  As soon as I begin dreaming of
something nice they are sure to wake me!" Miruit
grumbled.
</p>

<p>
"And what were you dreaming of?" asked Dio.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, all sorts of things.  Too good to tell."  Suddenly
she came up to Dio, bent down and whispered
in her ear:
</p>

<p>
"It was about you.  I dreamt that you ... No,
I can't say it before him; he will hear and pull my
ears."
</p>

<p>
"I will do it anyhow, you fidget!  Do you imagine
I don't know where you go gadding every day?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, thank you for reminding me.  I am late!
My merchant must be waiting for me and raging,
and he had promised me a necklace for to-day.  Mine
is so shabby that I am simply ashamed to wear it."
</p>

<p>
"You nasty hussy!" Pentaur shouted at her with
sudden anger.  "Mixing yourself up with an unclean
dog, an uncircumcised!"
</p>

<p>
"He may be an unclean dog, but he is rich and he
feeds me and there is no making broth with your
holiness!" the girl answered back insolently, imitating
old market women.  "It is four months since we
have had any flour or grain or beer or oil, it's no
joke!  We've tightened our belts on the hunger
rations, we've got as thin as locusts on the Salty
Lakes.  A well-fed devil is stronger than a hungry
god; other people's Baal may be of avail and our
own Ram is meek but not sleek!"
</p>

<p>
"Ah, you wretch!  Do you want to be thrown into
the pit?"
</p>

<p>
"Into the pit?  No, sir, that's more than you can
do!  Times have changed, you can't throw innocent
people into the pit nowadays.  If you try to lay
hands on me I'll run away and you won't catch me!
I am a free bird&mdash;wherever there is food, there is
my home."
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Oh, birds of Araby,<br>
  Oh, myrrh anointed!"<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
she sang, turning the tambourine above her head as
she ran towards the staircase.  The gazelle followed
her like a dog.
</p>

<p>
At the top of the stairs she ran into Zenra, Dio's
old nurse, and nearly knocked her down.
</p>

<p>
"Plague take you, you giddy goat!" swore the old
woman and going up to Dio handed her a letter.
Dio opened it and read:
</p>

<p><p class="poem">
</p>

<p class="letter">
I am going to-morrow.  If you want to go with me,
make ready.  I must see you to-day before sunset.  I will
wait for you at the White House.  I will send a boat for
you.  May Aton keep you.  Your faithful friend,
</p>

<p class="letter">
Tutankhaton.
</p>

<p><p class="poem"></p>

<p>
"The messenger is waiting, what shall I tell him?"
Zenra asked.
</p>

<p>
"Tell him I will come."
</p>

<p>
When Zenra had gone, Dio looked at Pentaur.
Like all the priestesses of the Great Mother she was
skilled in the art of healing; she had seen people
die and remembered the fateful sign&mdash;the seal of
death&mdash;which sometimes appears in a face when the
end is near.
</p>

<p>
She suddenly fancied she saw that sign in Pentaur's
face.  'He is young, healthy, there is no danger
in sight.  Riot?  No, it is nonsense,' she thought, and
as she looked at him more intently the sign disappeared.
</p>

<p>
"Are you going?" he asked quietly, but so firmly
that she understood she must not deceive him.
</p>

<p>
"Tuta is going to-morrow and I do not know yet.
Maybe I will not go...."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, you will.  You wanted to go as soon as
possible, you know."
</p>

<p>
"I did and now, all of a sudden, I am afraid."
</p>

<p>
"What of?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know.  I was not burned at the stake
then, and now&mdash;it is like going from one fire to
another....  You remember what you told me about
the king...."
</p>

<p>
"Don't, Dio.  What is the good?  You will go
anyway."
</p>

<p>
"No, you must tell me.  Taur, my dear brother, if
you love me, tell me all you know about him.  I
want to know all."
</p>

<p>
She took his hand and he did not draw it away
this time.
</p>

<p>
"You will go anyway, you will go!" he repeated
sadly.  "You love him, that is why you are afraid;
you know you will not escape; you fly like a moth
to the flame.  You were not burned in that other
flame, but you will be in this...."
</p>

<p>
He paused, and then asked her:
</p>

<p>
"Will you go to see Ptamose?"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly, I will not leave without seeing him."
</p>

<p>
"Do see him.  He knows everything&mdash;he will tell
you better than I can."
</p>

<p>
Ptamose, the high-priest of Amon and King Akhnaton's
bitterest enemy, had long asked Dio to come
to him, but she had not done so yet and only now,
before going away, decided to see him.
</p>

<p>
"Ptamose is nothing to me," she went on.  "I
want to know from you.  You had loved him once,
why do you hate him now?"
</p>

<p>
"It is not him I hate.  Do you know, Dio, I
sometimes fancy..."
</p>

<p>
He looked at her with the smile of a frightened
child looking at a grown-up person.
</p>

<p>
"Well, tell me, don't be afraid, I understand!"
</p>

<p>
"I sometimes fancy that he is not quite human...."
</p>

<p>
"Not quite human?" she repeated in surprise:
there was something knowing, something clairvoyant
in his face and voice.
</p>

<p>
"There are dolls like that," he went on, with the
same smile.  "If you pull a string, they dance.  That's
what he is like, he does not do anything of himself,
but somebody does it for him.  Don't you understand?
Perhaps you will when you see him."
</p>

<p>
"Have you seen much of him?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  We were pupils of the Heliopolis priests
together&mdash;he, Merira, who is now the high priest
of Aton, and myself.  I was thirteen then and the
prince fourteen.  He was very handsome, and gentle,
very gentle, like the god whose name is Quiet
Heart."
</p>

<p>
"Osiris?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  I loved him as my own soul.  He often
went to the desert to pray or, perhaps, simply to be
alone.  One day he went&mdash;and disappeared.  We
looked and looked for him, and thought he was lost
altogether.  At last he was found among the
shepherds in the fields of Rostia where the Pyramids are
and the Sphinx&mdash;the ancient god of the sun, Aton.
He was lying on the sand like one dead, probably
after an epileptic fit&mdash;it was then he began having
fits.  And when they brought him to the town I did
not know him; it was he, and not he, his double, a
changeling&mdash;as I have said just now, he was not
quite human.  Perhaps it was there in the desert
that <i>he</i> entered into him...."
</p>

<p>
"Whom do you mean?"
</p>

<p>
"The spirit of the desert, Set."
</p>

<p>
"The Devil?"
</p>

<p>
"You call him the devil and we&mdash;another god.
Well, that was the beginning of it all."
</p>

<p>
"Wait a minute," she interrupted.  "You say
Aton is an ancient god?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, more ancient than Amon."
</p>

<p>
"And you worship him?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, just as we worship all the gods: all the
gods are members of the One."
</p>

<p>
"Then what is your quarrel about?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, did you think it was about this?  Come,
we are not such fools as not to know that Amon and
Aton are one and the same god.  The visible face of
the Sun is Aton, its hidden face is Amon, but there
is only one Sun, only one God.  No, the dispute is
not between Aton and Amon, but between Set and
Osiris.  Set has killed and dismembered Osiris and
he wants to kill and dismember the holy land of
Osiris, Egypt.  This is why he has entered the
king....  You are not listening, Dio."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I am.  But you keep telling me by whom the
king is possessed and I want to know what he
himself is.  Simply wicked?"
</p>

<p>
"No, not wicked.  It is just like the devil's cunning
to possess a saint and not a man of evil.  The country
is perishing in a fratricidal war, the fields are
empty, the granaries plundered, the people's skin
is black with parching hunger, the mothers cook
their own children for food&mdash;and it is all his doing,
the saint's.  And he has done more: he has killed
God.  'There is no Son,' he said.  'I am the Son.'"
</p>

<p>
"Never, never has he said that!" cried Dio, and
there was such a fire in her eyes as though she, too,
were possessed by Set.  "'There has been no Son,
but there will be'&mdash;this is what he said.  Has been or
will be&mdash;the whole question is in that."
</p>

<p>
"Cursed is he who says there has been no Son,
said Pentaur, turning pale.
</p>

<p>
"Cursed is he who says there will be no Son,"
said Dio, turning pale also.
</p>

<p>
Both were silent&mdash;they understood that they had
cursed each other.
</p>

<p>
He buried his face in his hands.  She went up to
him and, without speaking, kissed him on the head,
as a mother kisses a sick child.  She looked into his
face and it suddenly seemed to her again that there
was the seal of death upon it:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Death is now to me like sweetest myrrh,<br>
  Death is now to me like healing,<br>
  Death is now to me like refreshing rain,<br>
  Death is now to me like a home to an exile!<br>
</p>

<p class="dropcap">
Khnumhotep was an honest and
god-fearing man.
</p>

<p>
He welcomed Dio in his house
as though she had been a member
of his own family, not because she
was under the patronage of
Tutankhaton, who had power and influence at court,
but because exiles were under the protection of
the immortal gods.  While he was the chief
superintendent of Amon's granaries he might have taken
bribes like everyone else; but he did not.  When
Amon's sanctuary was closed and Khnumhotep
lost his post, he might have received another and
a better one, had he been false to the faith of his
fathers; but he remained true to it.  At the time of
famine he might have sold at an exorbitant price
the corn from his estates in the Lake country, Miuer,
which had not suffered from drought, but he sold it
cheaper than usual and gave away one granary-full
to the starving.
</p>

<p>
He lived in this way because he remembered the
wisdom of his fathers: "a man lives after death and
all his works with him"; he remembered the scales
with the heart of the dead man upon one of them,
and the lightest feather of the goddess Maat, Truth,
upon the other,&mdash;the sharp eye of the god Tot,
the Measurer, watching the pointer of the scales.
</p>

<p>
In his youth he doubted whether the short day of
life was not worth more than the dark eternity and
whether those who said "a man dying is like a bubble
bursting on the water&mdash;nothing is left" were not
right.  But as he grew older he felt more and more
clearly&mdash;grasped it, as it were, as a hand grasps a
wrapped-up object&mdash;that there was something beyond
the grave, and that since no one knew anything about
it for certain, the simplest and wisest thing to do
was to believe as his fathers had done.
</p>

<p>
Khnumhotep, or Khnum, was over sixty, but he
did not consider himself old, hoping to live the full
measure of man's life&mdash;a hundred and ten years.
</p>

<p>
Some forty years before he began building for
himself 'an eternal house,' a tomb in the Hills of the
West, Amenti, also according to the ancient
commandment 'prepare a fine tomb for thyself and
remember it every day of thy life, for thou knowest
not the hour of thy death.'  For forty years he had
been digging in the rock a deep cave with subterranean
halls and passages, adorning it like a wedding
chamber and collecting in it a dowry for his
soul, the bride.  He did it all cheerfully according
to the saying, 'coffin, thou hast been made for a
feast; grave, thou hast been dug for merriment.'
</p>

<p>
On the afternoon when Dio and Pentaur were
talking on the flat roof of Khnum's summer house,
Khnum was sitting in a light wooden shelter,
supported by four pillars, near the winter house at the
other end of the pond.  He sat in a carved ebony chair
that had a leather cushion and a footstool; his wife
Nibituia sat beside him on a small folding chair.
</p>

<p>
Both were dressed in robes of finely pleated white
flaxen material, not too transparent, as became
elderly people; hers was narrow and reached to the ankles
and his was wider and shorter; their feet were bare.
The brick floor of the shelter was covered with mats
for warmth and a servant boy was holding in
readiness papyrus slippers.
</p>

<p>
Khnum took the wig off his closely cropped grey
hair and hung it on a wooden stand close by; men
took off their wigs like caps; but Nibituia's huge
black wig, shiny as though it had been lacquered,
with two thick twisted cords at the sides, rose above
her head, pushing the ears forward and making the
old woman's wrinkled face look like a bat's.
</p>

<p>
Khnum was so tall that his wife, who was short,
looked almost a dwarf beside him; straight, spare,
bony, he had a face that seemed carved of hard
brown wood and had a sullen, angry look; but when
he smiled it grew very kind.
</p>

<p>
On week days Nibituia was busy with housekeeping
from morning till night, looking after the weaving,
the mat-making, the cooking and the washing,
but on holidays, such as that day&mdash;the day of
Khonsu, the god of the Moon, she gave herself a rest,
engaging in a light and at the same time pious
occupation.  Two little pots and two baskets stood before
her on a low round table: out of one of them she
took dead beetles, scarabees, butterflies, bees,
grasshoppers, ripped them open with a flint knife, and
taking with a bone spoon a drop of Arabian gum out
of one pot and a drop of Lebanon cedar resin out of
another, embalmed the dead creatures; then she
wrapped them up in tiny white linen bandages, like
real little mummies, and put them into the other
basket.  She did all this quickly and neatly as a
work she was accustomed to do.  In the garden there
was a sandhill of Amenti&mdash;Eternal West&mdash;a cemetery
for these little mummies.
</p>

<p>
A middle aged man with a sly and merry face,
Inioteph or Ini, was sitting cross-legged on the floor
in front of Khnum; he was a clerk in the Surveying
Department, managed Khnum's estates and transacted
legal business for him.  Bare to his waist, he
wore nothing but an apron; there was an inkpot on
his belt and a writing reed behind his ear, and in
his hand he held a roll of papyrus with the account
of sacks of grain which had just been brought
down the river in barges from Miuer.
</p>

<p>
"When was the decree received?" Khnum asked.
</p>

<p>
"In the night and it must be carried out to-day,
that the sun may not set on disobedience to the king,"
Ini answered.
</p>

<p>
"Quite, quite, quite," Khnum rapped out like a
woodpecker tapping, as was his habit.  "They
persecuted the Father, they persecuted the Mother, and
now it is the turn of the Son!"
</p>

<p>
The Son was Khonsu&mdash;the Osiris of Thebes,
born of the Father Amon and the Mother Mut.
</p>

<p>
"But how is he to be destroyed?  He is made of
gold," Khnum said.
</p>

<p>
"They will throw him into the furnace, melt him,
make coins out of the gold, buy bread and give it to
the starving: eat the god and praise the king!"
Inioteph explained.
</p>

<p>
"Surely this is very wrong?  Uhuh have mercy
upon us!" Nibituia said with a sigh.
</p>

<p>
Uhuh was a very ancient god forgotten by everyone;
he had no idols, no temples, no sacrifices, no
priests&mdash;nothing was left of him but a name.  People
remembered merely that there had been a god Uhuh,
but they had long forgotten what he ruled over and
what he looked like.  And this was the very reason
why Nibituia liked him and pitied him and at
difficult moments called not upon the great Amon, but
upon the obscure Uhuh.  "No one prays to him,
poor Uhuh, but I will pray and he will have mercy
upon me," the old lady used to say.
</p>

<p>
"And what do the people say?" Khnum asked.
</p>

<p>
"They haven't much hope of the bread," said Ini,
screwing up his eyes with a sly air.  "'The king's
clerks, Aton's hangers-on, will steal it all,' they
say, 'and we shan't get a morsel!'  And the priests
incite them, of course: stand up for the god, do
not allow the holy image to be defiled!  And saying
such things to the people is like setting fire to straw.
You know yourself, my lord, what times these are;
I shouldn't wonder if there were a mutiny."
</p>

<p>
"Quite, quite, quite!  Mutiny is a dreadful thing,"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing could be worse!  It is said: 'the earth will
tremble, unable to endure that slaves should be
masters.'  But indeed what is one to expect of
slaves when the king himself...."
</p>

<p>
"Don't presume to speak about the king; you will
be food for fish," Khnum restrained him.
</p>

<p>
That meant: if anyone found fault with the king
he would be thrown after death into the river to be
eaten by fishes.
</p>

<p>
"And what is the second decree about?"
</p>

<p>
"About making burial grounds crown property.
They are to be taken from the rich and given to the
poor: 'it is time the dead stopped taking food out of
the mouths of the living.'"
</p>

<p>
"Quite, quite, quite," Khnum repeated, and said
nothing more, watching Nibituia's little hands move
rapidly as she wrapped up the mummy of a grasshopper.
</p>

<p>
"Uhuh have mercy upon us!" she sighed again
and, leaving the grasshopper, looked at her husband
with round, frightened eyes.  "How can this be,
Khnum?  What will the dead live by?"
</p>

<p>
"Keep quiet, old woman, that's beyond you, you
mind your beetles!" he grumbled, patting her on the
shoulder with a smile, and his face suddenly became
very kind and curiously like his wife's face in spite
of the difference in their features; they seemed to
be brother and sister: happily married couples often
develop a likeness in their old age.
</p>

<p>
"The dead will have enough to live on, don't you
fear; we, the living, might fare worse!" he added,
gloomily.
</p>

<p>
He really was not much concerned about the dead.
If a decree were issued forbidding people to eat and
drink they would go on eating and drinking just as
before; the same thing would happen about this
decree: the living would not stop feeding the dead,
for the very being of Egypt rested upon this, that
the living and the dead had the same food, the same
drink&mdash;the body and blood of Khonsu Osiris, the
Son of God.
</p>

<p>
"I expect we shall have to bribe Aton's spies after
all," Inioteph went on.
</p>

<p>
He did not like Khnum's fearlessness; like all
servants who are a little too forward, he had the
bad habit of frightening his master in order to gain
importance in his eyes.
</p>

<p>
"They have sniffed out, the dogs, that in your
honour's tomb two images of Amon have not been
effaced.  'We must inspect it,' they say.  And if they
discover it, there will be trouble; they will spoil
everything and defile the tomb or prosecute you&mdash;there
will be no end to it!"
</p>

<p>
"How did they find out?" Khnum asked in surprise.
</p>

<p>
"Someone must have informed against you."
</p>

<p>
"Who could it have been?  No stranger has seen it."
</p>

<p>
"It must have been one of your own people, then."
</p>

<p>
"It is he, he, Yubra, the villain, the snake!"
Nibituia cried in alarm.  "I told you, Khnum, don't
keep that plague in the house, send him to the Red
Mountains to break stones or to dig canals in the
Delta, so that he may get the ague, the wretch!  It is
not for nothing he has made friends with Aton's
servants.  Just think what he has done!  It is dreadful
to think of&mdash;raising his hand against the holy
Ushebti, the godless creature!  And you spare
him...."
</p>

<p>
"I have thrown him into the pit, what more do
you want?"
</p>

<p>
"What does the snake care about the pit?  He likes
being there better than working.  I know, Khnum,
you gave orders for him to have two loaves of bread
and a pot of beer a day, though you tried to hide
it from me.  He is eating his fill, the swine, growing
fat and laughing at you for all your kindness!  He
sleeps all day or sings hymns to his unclean god, fie
upon him!"
</p>

<p>
"Whatever is the matter with you, little beetle?"
said Khnum, looking at her in surprise.
</p>

<p>
They exchanged a deep look and he turned away
from her, frowning sternly.  Nibituia got up and
bowed low to her husband:
</p>

<p>
"Forgive your servant, my lord, if I have said
anything wrong in my foolishness.  You know better.
But I am uneasy&mdash;" she could not resist looking at
him significantly once more, "I am very uneasy
about you, Khnum!  You are fond of him, you spoil
him, and he is sharpening a knife against you,
nursing malice in return for all your kindness&mdash;and
such malice is worse than any other."
</p>

<p>
Ini was smiling to himself: he had gained his
object and alarmed his masters, though he himself
did not know how he had done it.  Yubra was not
of sufficient consequence for them to be alarmed on
his account.
</p>

<p>
"Well, that's all right," said Khnum, as though
coming to himself.  "I have known Yubra long
enough: he is as stupid as an ass but he would not
do .... such a thing: he is a faithful servant."
</p>

<p>
And breaking off suddenly, he asked Ini: "Are
they storing the corn?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, master."
</p>

<p>
"Let us go and see; they are sure not to spread it
evenly."
</p>

<p>
He got up and walked across the garden to the
threshing yard.  "Dead flies spoil a fragrant ointment,
so a little folly spoils the whole life of an
honourable man," Khnum had often thought of late,
with a bitter smile.  This was what had happened in
his house.
</p>

<p>
Wise men knew that the next world, 'the second
Egypt,' was exactly similar to this one, though the
semblance was reversed as in a mirror: here everything
was for the worse and made for death, while
there everything was for the best, for everlasting
life.  But there, too, in the heavenly fields of Ialu,
the shadows of the dead, the blessed Ka, ploughed
the land, sowed, reaped, gathered in the harvest,
dug canals and built houses.  For all this work masters
needed slaves.  This was why they placed in each
tomb three hundred and sixty-five clay figures&mdash;according
to the number of days in the year&mdash;each
with a spade in its hand, a set of tools in a bag on
its back and a hieroglyphic inscription on the breast:
"Thou, Ushebti, Respondent so and so, belonging
to such and such a master, come up instead of me,
say for me 'Here am I,' if I am called out to work."  At
the resurrection of the dead, when the masters
came to life, the slaves came to life, too, and went
to work in the fields of Ialu, for there, as here,
slaves worked and masters enjoyed themselves.
</p>

<p>
Khnum had ordered a sample two dozen Ushebti
of the modeller who worked at adorning tombs.  He
made them so cleverly that from the clay dolls' faces
one could tell which of Khnum's servants they
represented: this was to enable each soul to find its
body.
</p>

<p>
When the modeller brought the figures Khnum's
slaves ran out to meet him at the gate, by the box
of old Yubra, the porter, jostling, shouting and
laughing, pleased as children: each was in a hurry
to find and recognize his own doll.  "Which is me?
Which is me?" they all kept saying.
</p>

<p>
Yubra came up, too, and also asked "Which is
me?"  The potter gave him his doll.  Yubra took it,
examined it, asked to have the inscription read to
him, and, suddenly, he seemed like one possessed.
Those who were present said afterwards his face
turned quite dark, he trembled all over and, shotting
"I don't want to, I don't want to!" flung the clay
figure on the ground and broke it to bits.  All stood
still, spellbound with horror, while Yubra went on
breaking the other dolls arranged on an ironing
board from the laundry.  Then they rushed at him,
but could not master him at once&mdash;he fought like
a fury.  At last, when he had broken more than half
the dolls, he was overpowered, and, with his hands
bound, brought before Khnum for judgment.
</p>

<p>
It was a terrible act of sacrilege: every mummy,
not only of man, but even of a beast, was the body of
the dead god himself, Osiris-Amenti.
</p>

<p>
When Khnum asked Yubra why he had done it,
Yubra answered firmly and quietly:
</p>

<p>
"To save my soul.  Here I am a slave, but there
I shall be free."
</p>

<p>
He would say nothing more.
</p>

<p>
Khnum thought that Yubra had suddenly lost
his reason or was possessed by the devil.  He was
sorry for his old and faithful servant.  He could not
pardon Yubra completely, but he punished him lightly
and did not even have him beaten; he merely had
him put into the pit; he thought Yubra would come
to his senses.  But Yubra had been in the pit for four
days and was as obdurate as ever.
</p>

<p>
There was a special reason why Khnum was so
kind to him.  In his youth Khnum liked to hunt
crocodiles in the Lake country, Miuer, where he had a
large estate by the town Shedet, consecrated to the
crocodile-headed Sun god, Sobek.  He used to spend
several days there during the hunting season.
</p>

<p>
Every morning, while he was still in bed, a freshly
washed and pleated white robe was brought to him
by the fifteen-year old Maïta, a clever laundress&mdash;wife
and sister of the young gardener Yubra: poor
people often married their sisters so as not to divide
the property.
</p>

<p>
At dusk Khnum used to hear in the back yard,
where some planks ran out from the laundry into the
pond, the loud squelching of the bat over the wet
linen and Maïta's girlish voice singing:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "My sister is on the opposite bank<br>
  The river flows between us,<br>
  And a crocodile lies on the sand.<br>
  Fearless I go into the water,<br>
  Water is to me like the dry land,<br>
  Love gives me courage and strength,<br>
  Love&mdash;the all-powerful magic."<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
But one could hear from her voice that she did not
yet know what love meant.  "She will soon learn,"
Khnum thought with quiet pity.
</p>

<p>
One day she sang a different song:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "The pomegranate tree spoke and said:<br>
  My round fruits are her breasts,<br>
  The seeds in the fruit are her teeth,<br>
  The heart of my fruits are her lips,<br>
  And what the sister does with the brother,<br>
  Gladdened by the sparkling wine,<br>
  Is hidden by my branches thick."<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
And for the first time Khnum detected something
not childish in Maïta's childish voice.  "She will be
like the rest," he thought, without any pity, and all
of a sudden the flame of Set breathed into his face
and lust stung his heart like a scorpion.
</p>

<p>
He knew that neither men nor gods would condemn
him if he, the master, said to his slave "come
into my bed," as simply as on a hot day he would
say to her, "give me a drink."  But Khnum was
indeed a just and pious man.  He remembered that
besides his wife Nibituia he had twelve concubines
and as many beautiful slaves as he liked, while
Yubra had only Maïta.  Was the master to take his
servant's only lamb?  "This shall not be," he decided,
and he left the Lake country never to return.
</p>

<p>
But he could not forget Maïta.  The flame of Set
scorched his bones as the wind of the desert scorches
the grass.  He could not eat or drink or sleep and
grew thin as a lath.
</p>

<p>
He had said nothing to Nibituia, but she guessed
the truth.  One early morning, while he was still
asleep, Maïta came into the bedroom of his country
house near Thebes, bringing freshly washed clothes.
He woke up thinking he saw her in a dream or a
vision, and when he understood she was real he
asked:
</p>

<p>
"Where is Yubra, your brother?"
</p>

<p>
"Far away beyond the sea," she answered and
burst into tears.  Then she came up to him slowly,
sat on the side of the bed, and with downcast eyes
said, blushing and smiling through her tears:
</p>

<p>
"My mistress has sent me to my master.  Here
I am, your slave."
</p>

<p>
And Khnum asked her no more about Yubra.
</p>

<p>
That year was the happiest year of his life; and
the best of all was that Nibituia had grown just as
fond of Maïta as he was, perhaps even more so.
She was jealous not of her but of other women and,
strange to say, reproached him for preferring
herself to Maïta.  And Khnum did not know whom he
loved most&mdash;the mistress or the slave: both these
loves merged into one like two scents blending into
one fragrance.
</p>

<p>
When he recalled it now, after thirty years, he
whispered with tears of tenderness for the old
companion of his life: "My poor little beetle!"
</p>

<p>
Nibituia had sent Yubra, the gardener, to Canaan
to collect foreign flowers and plants for Khnum's
gardens.  And when, after a year's absence he
returned, Maïta was no more: she had died in
childbirth.
</p>

<p>
Khnum treated Yubra handsomely: he presented
him with a fine plot of land, four pairs of oxen and
a new wife&mdash;one of his own concubines.  No one
knew whether Yubra remembered Maïta or had
forgotten her with a new wife, for he never spoke of
her and behaved as though nothing had happened.
</p>

<p>
When Yubra had grown old and could no longer
work in the fields Khnum took him into his house
and gave him the honourable post of doorkeeper.
</p>

<p>
For thirty years Yubra had been an obedient slave
and now all of a sudden he rebelled and said:
</p>

<p>
"I don't want to!  Here I am a slave, but there I
shall be free."  For thirty years Khnum had not
thought that he had done any evil to Yubra and
now, all of a sudden, he thought: "Dead flies spoil
a fragrant ointment and so a little folly spoils the
whole life of an honourable man!"

</div>

<p class="dropcap">
The conical clay granaries stood by
the back wall of the granary yard.
Every one of them had a round
opening at the top for pouring in
the grain and a window with a
board that lifted for pouring it out.
</p>

<p>
Slaves, brown as brick and naked but for white
aprons and caps, were climbing up the ladders to
the upper windows of the granaries, pouring into
them grain that glided down with a gentle rustle
like liquid gold.
</p>

<p>
This was the new corn from the Miuer Lakes.
Looking at it Khnum remembered the starving and
gave orders that a whole granary-full should be
given to them.
</p>

<p>
Then he walked to the cattle-yard where the
prison-pit was.  It was a square hole dug in the
ground, with brick walls and a brick bridge-like
roof with a grated window in it.
</p>

<p>
Khnum went up to the pit, bent down to the
window and heard quiet singing.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Glory be to thee, Aton, the living and only God,<br>
  Who hast created the heavens and the secrets thereof!<br>
  Thou art in heaven and here upon earth is thy son<br>
  Akhnaton, the joy of the Sun!"<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The man in the pit must have caught sight of
Khnum, for he suddenly sang aloud and, it seemed
to Khnum, with insolent defiance:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "When thou descendest beyond the sky<br>
  The dead come to life in thy life;<br>
  Thou givest their nostrils the breath of life,<br>
  And the air to their stifled throats,<br>
  Glorifying thee from their narrow tombs<br>
  The dead stretch forth their hands,<br>
  And they who are at rest rejoice."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Khnum walked away and, returning to the shelter
by the big pond, sat down in his old place beside
Nibituia who was still wrapping up her beetles.
Inioteph began reading a new endless account of
sacks of corn.  Khnum felt dreary.  He was conscious
of the ominous weight in his right side, under the
last rib; he suffered from his liver.  His father had
died of the same complaint at the age of eighty&mdash;"Perhaps
I, too, will die before I have fulfilled my
span of days," thought Khnum.
</p>

<p>
He liked to have something of his tomb dowry
brought to him every day.  To-day they brought him
the sacred Beetle, Kheper, made of lapis-lazuli.
</p>

<p>
The great beetle of the Sun, Ra-Kheper, rolls
along the sky its great ball as the dung beetle rolls its
small ball along the earth.  The Sun is the great heart
of the world; the human heart is a small sun.  This
was why they put inside the mummy, in the place of
the heart which was taken out, the Sun beetle Kheper
with a hieroglyphic inscription&mdash;the prayer of the
dead at the Last Judgment: "Heart of my birth,
heart of my mother, my earthly heart, do not rise
against me, do not bear witness against me!"
</p>

<p>
"I shouldn't wonder if mine did rise against me,"
thought Khnum, recalling Yubra, and he smiled:
"Extraordinary!  Fancy comparing the sun to a
dung beetle!"
</p>

<p>
He recalled another prayer of the dead: "May my
soul walk every day in the garden beside my pond;
may it flutter like a bird among the branches of my
trees; may it rest in the shade of my sycamore; may
it rise up to heaven and come down to earth
unhindered."
</p>

<p>
"And perhaps it is all nonsense," he thought as he
used to think in his youth.  "A man dies&mdash;like a
water bubble bursting&mdash;and nothing is left of him.
And, indeed, it may be as well, for what if one grew
bored there also?"
</p>

<p>
He had once seen an eclipse of the sun: the day
had been fine and bright and suddenly everything
grew dim and grey, as though covered with a layer
of ash, and all was dull, numb and dead.  It was
the same now.  "It's my liver," he thought, "and
Yubra, too."
</p>

<p>
"I must put an end to it," he said aloud.  "Go
and fetch him!"
</p>

<p>
"Whom, master?" Inioteph asked, looking at him
in surprise.
</p>

<p>
Nibituia too raised her eyes in alarm.
</p>

<p>
At that moment Dio and Pentaur came into the
garden from the roof of the summer house: Zenra
had told her mistress that Tuta had sent a boat for
her.
</p>

<p>
As they were passing the shelter by the big pond,
Khnum called to them:
</p>

<p>
"I am just going to judge Yubra, my slave.  You
be judges, too."
</p>

<p>
He made Pentaur sit down beside him and Dio
sat on the mat by Nibituia.
</p>

<p>
Yubra, with his arms tied behind his back, was
brought in and made to kneel before Khnum.  He
was a little old man with a dark wrinkled face that
looked like a stone or a lump of earth.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Yubra, how much longer are you going to
sit in the pit?" Khnum asked.
</p>

<p>
"As long as it is your pleasure," Yubra answered,
with downcast eyes and, Khnum fancied, with the
same defiance with which he sang Aton's hymn in
the pit.
</p>

<p>
"Look here, old man; I have spared you and not
handed you over to the magistrates, but do you
know what the lawful penalty is for what you have
done?  To be buried alive or thrown into the water
with a stone round your neck."
</p>

<p>
"Well, let them put me to death for truth's sake."
</p>

<p>
"For what truth?  Say plainly what possessed you
to raise your hand against the holy Ushebti?"
</p>

<p>
"I have told you already."
</p>

<p>
"Surely you can take the trouble to say it again."
</p>

<p>
"I did it for my soul's sake.  To save my soul.
Here I am a slave, but there I shall be free."
</p>

<p>
He paused and then said in a changed voice:
"There the wicked cease from troubling and the
weary are at rest; the prisoners are at peace and do
not hear the gaoler's voice; there the great and the
small are equal and the slave is free from his master."
</p>

<p>
He paused again and asked:
</p>

<p>
"Do you know the parable of the rich and the
poor?"
</p>

<p>
"What parable?"
</p>

<p>
"Shall I tell it you?"
</p>

<p>
"Do."
</p>

<p>
"There were two men in the world, a rich one and
a poor one.  The rich lived in luxury and the poor
was wretched.  They both died and the rich received
an honourable burial and the poor was thrown away
like a dead dog.  And they both appeared before
the judgment seat of Osiris.  The works of the rich
man were weighed and, behold, his evil deeds
outweighed his good deeds.  And they put him under a
door so that the door hinge entered his eye and
turned in it each time that the door opened or shut.
The poor man's deeds were weighed, too, and, behold,
his good deeds outweighed his evil deeds.  And
he was clothed in a robe of white linen, called in to
the feast and placed at the right hand of the god."
</p>

<p>
"Quite, quite, quite.  And to whom does the parable
refer?  To you and me?"
</p>

<p>
"No, to everyone.  I have seen all the oppressions
that are done under the sun and, behold, the tears
of such as were oppressed and they had no comforter;
and on the side of their oppressors there was
power; but they had no one to defend them.  The
poor are pushed off the roads, the sufferers are
forced into hiding, the orphan is torn away from its
mother's breast and the beggar is made to pay a
pledge.  Moans are heard from the city and the
souls of the victims cry unto the Lord...."
</p>

<p>
He raised his eyes to heaven and his face seemed
to light up.
</p>

<p>
"Blessed is He who cometh in the name of the
Lord!  He shall come down like rain on the freshly
cut meadow, like dew upon the withered fields.  He
shall save the souls of the humble and the oppressors
he shall lay low.  All the peoples shall worship him.
Behold He comes quickly!"
</p>

<p>
Khnum felt dreary; everything was as grey and
dull as when the sun was eclipsed.  And it was all
Yubra's doing.  He had called him to be judged
and now it was as though Yubra were judging him,
his master.
</p>

<p>
"Who comes?  Who comes?" he cried with sudden
anger.
</p>

<p>
Yubra did not answer at once.  He looked at
Khnum from under his brows as though again with
mocking defiance.
</p>

<p>
"Second Osiris," he said quietly at last.
</p>

<p>
"What are you talking about, you fool?  There is
only one Osiris, there will be no second."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, there will."
</p>

<p>
"He must have heard from the Jews about their
Messiah," Inioteph remarked, with a jeer.
</p>

<p>
Yubra glanced at him in silence and then said,
lower still: "There has been no Son yet; the Son is
to come."
</p>

<p>
"What?  There has been no Son?  Ah, you infidel!
So it's against Him you have rebelled?" Khnum
shouted furiously.
</p>

<p>
"The liver rushes to his head," his doctor used to
say about these sudden fits of fury.
</p>

<p>
Turning purple he got up from his chair heavily,
walked up f o Yubra and, seizing him by the shoulder,
shook him so that the old man staggered.
</p>

<p>
"I see through you, you rebel!  Take care, I will
have no nonsense."
</p>

<p>
"A slave's ear is on his back; a good whipping
would soon make him drop this folly," Inioteph
incited him.
</p>

<p>
Yubra said nothing.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, the snake, he holds his tongue and lies low,"
Khnum went on, and bending still lower over him
looked into his face, "What have I done to you?
What have I done to you?  Why do you hate me?"
</p>

<p>
Had Yubra answered simply "because you robbed
me of Maïta," Khnum's anger might have died down
at once: his heart would have risen against him and
denounced him as at the Last Judgment.  But Yubra
answered slyly:
</p>

<p>
"I bear you no evil."
</p>

<p>
And he added so low that only Khnum heard him:
"God shall judge between us."
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean?  What are you thinking of?"
Khnum began and broke off, unable to look his slave
in the face; he understood it was not easy to take
dead flies out of the fragrant ointment.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, you stinking dog!" he shouted, beside himself
with fury: the liver rushed to his head.  "You
bear me no evil, but who is it informed against me,
who told the king's spies that two images of Amon
in my tomb have not been effaced?  Tell me, who?"
</p>

<p>
"I have not told, but even if I had I would not
have been to blame: it is the king's command that
images of Amon should be destroyed," Yubra
answered, it seemed to Khnum, with insolent defiance.
</p>

<p>
"So you try to threaten me, you dog!  Wait a bit,
I'll give it you!"
</p>

<p>
He raised his stick.  It was a thick, heavy stick
of acacia wood, hard as iron: had he brought it
down on Yubra's head he would have killed him.
But God saved them both.  Their eyes met and it was
as though Maïta had looked at Khnum.
</p>

<p>
He slowly lowered the stick without touching
Yubra's head, staggered and fell into his chair,
burying his face in his hands.  He was motionless
for a few minutes, then he uncovered his face and
said, without looking at Yubra:
</p>

<p>
"Away with you!  Begone!  You are not a slave
to me any more.  Untie his hands and let him go,
no one is to interfere with him.  I have pardoned
him."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Perhaps I was wrong," said Dio to Pentaur, as
she walked with him across the garden to Tuta's
boat in the canal.  "Perhaps you Egyptians can rebel
after all...."
</p>

<p>
"You judge by Yubra?" Pentaur asked.
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  Have you many such?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, we have."
</p>

<p>
"Well, then, there is sure to be rebellion.  How
strange it is, Taur: you and I have just been
disputing whether the Son had come already or
is to come, and here is the same thing over
again..."
</p>

<p>
"It is the same thing everywhere."
</p>

<p>
"And the rebellion is about this, too?" Dio asked.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, it is.  You are glad?"
</p>

<p>
Dio did not answer, she seemed lost in thought.
Pentaur paused, too, and then said:
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps the world will perish through this...."
</p>

<p>
"Let it!" she answered, and it seemed to him that
the fire of rebellion was already burning in her eyes.
"Let the world perish if only He will come!"
</p>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-t.png" width="126" height="126" alt="T">
</div>

<p class="dropcap">
The boat was brought to the gates of
Khnum's garden by the Big Canal
which united the southern part of
the city with the north&mdash;Apet-Oisit,
where the throne of the world, the
Temple of Amon, stood.
</p>

<p>
Hearing that Tuta had put off his meeting with
her for a few hours, Dio decided to pass these
hours&mdash;perhaps the last&mdash;with Pentaur: she had not made
up her mind yet whether she was going away the next
day.  She wanted, too, to say good-bye to Amon's
Temple; she had grown to love this house of God,
the largest and most beautiful in the world, because
it was through it she had entered Egypt.
</p>

<p>
Surrounded by walls, three enormous sanctuaries
of Amon, Khonsu, and Mut&mdash;the Father, the Son,
and the Mother&mdash;towered above the endless multitude
of low, grey, flat houses made of river mud, like
swallows' nests.  Within the walls there were copses,
gardens, ponds, cattle-yards, cellars, granaries,
breweries, perfumeries and other buildings, a town within
the town, the City of God in the city of men.
</p>

<p>
During King Akhnaton's reign the place fell into
decay: the holy enclosures had been destroyed, the
treasuries robbed, the sanctuaries closed, the priests
driven away and the gods desecrated.
</p>

<p>
Having reached by boat the holy Road of the
Rams, Dio and her nurse Zenra, stepped into a litter
and Pentaur walked by their side.
</p>

<p>
Turning to the right into a by-road to the sanctuary
of Mut, they entered it through the northern
gates.
</p>

<p>
The sacred lake of the god Khonsu, Osiris the
Moon, shone, crescent-shaped, with a silvery
brilliance.  The rosy granite of the obelisks, the black
basalt of the colossi, the yellow sandstone of the
pylons, the green tops of the palms, bathed in the
molten gold of the afternoon sun, were mirrored in
the water with such clearness that one could see every
feather in the rainbow-coloured Falcons of the sun
at the top of the pylons and every hieroglyphic in the
multi-coloured inscriptions on the yellow sandstone;
it was as though there were another world down
there, the reverse of this one, exactly like it and yet
quite different.
</p>

<p>
By the shores of the lake some sandpits had been
dug, probably in order to defile the holy waters, and
bricklayers were getting clay from them.  The lake
in those places was shallow, its slimy bottom could
be seen and the stagnant water in the pools had a dull
rainbow glitter on the surface.  A huge statue of the
god Amon, of dark-red sandstone, had been thrown
near by, face downwards, and an ox, standing
knee-deep in water, was scratching its mud-coated side
against the sharp end of one of the two feathers in
the god's tiara; the smell of the pig-sty came from
the animal.
</p>

<p>
Next to the pits was a sanctuary of immemorial
antiquity consecrated to two goddess-mothers, Hekit
the Frog, and Tuart the Hippopotamus.
</p>

<p>
At the beginning of the world the divine Frog, the
midwife, crawled out of the primaeval slime and at
once began to help all women labouring of child;
she helped the birth of Khonsu-Osiris, the son of
God; she helped every dead man to rise again and
be born into eternal life.  Tuart, the Hippopotamus,
was as efficient a help in labour.
</p>

<p>
The copper doors of the sanctuary were locked
and sealed, but in the entry the two goddesses were
hidden from the king's spies in two vaulted niches
in the wall, behind torn curtains.  The huge frog
made of green jade with kind and intelligent round
eyes of yellow glass, was sitting on its cubical throne.
The pig-faced Hippopotamus, in a woman's wig,
was ferociously showing its teeth; made of grey
obsidian, with hanging breasts and monstrous belly,
it was standing on its hind legs, holding in its
forepaws the sign of eternal life&mdash;the looped cross Ankh.
</p>

<p>
A little girl of twelve, an Ethiopian, in the last
stage of pregnancy, had placed a wreath of lotus
flowers round the neck of the goddess and, kneeling
before her, was ardently praying with childish tears
for easy travail.
</p>

<p>
Zenra wanted to sacrifice to the mother-goddesses
two turtle doves for Dio, that the virgin might at
last become a mother.
</p>

<p>
They went into the portico.  An old priestess, who
looked rather like her goddess, the Frog, was bathing
in a copper basin of warm water two sacred ichneumons,
water animals something between a cat and a
rat, beloved by the god of the floods, Khnum-Ra.
After the bath the creatures ran away, playing; the
male chased the female.
</p>

<p>
"Pew-pew-pew!" the priestess called them quietly
and began feeding them out of her hands with bread
soaked in milk, muttering a prayer about a propitious
flood.
</p>

<p>
Then she went down to the lake and called:
</p>

<p>
"Sob!  Sob!  Sob!"
</p>

<p>
There was a splash at the other end of the lake
and, thrusting out its shining, slimy black head, a
huge crocodile, some nine feet long, sacred to Sobek,
the god of the Midnight Sun, rapidly swam across
in answer to the call.  Brass rings with bells glittered
on its front paws, there were rings in its ears and a
piece of red glass was stuck into the thick skin of
the head in the place of the ruby that had been
stripped from it.  The crocodile was so tame that it
allowed its attendant to clean its teeth with acacia
charcoal.
</p>

<p>
It crawled out of the water and stretched itself
at the feet of the priestess.  Squatting before it she
fed it with the meat and the honey cakes brought by
Zenra, fearlessly thrusting her left hand into the
open jaws of the beast; her right hand had been
bitten off by the crocodile while she was still a
child.
</p>

<p>
"I wish it had eaten me altogether," the old lady
used to say, "I then wouldn't have to see what is
going on now."
</p>

<p>
She did not go on to say "under the apostate king."
</p>

<p>
To be devoured by a sacred crocodile was regarded
as a most happy death: there was no need to embalm
or bury the body&mdash;one went straight from the holy
belly into paradise.
</p>

<p>
With motherly tenderness the old priestess stroked
the monster on its scaly back, calling it 'Sobby,'
'little one,' 'ducky.'  And it was strange to see the
beast's pig-like eyes gleam with responsive affection.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Well, how did you like our crocodile mother?"
Pentaur asked Dio with a smile when they came
out of the portico, leaving Zenra behind and telling
the litter to go on.
</p>

<p>
"I liked her very much," Dio answered, smiling also.
</p>

<p>
"Does it make you laugh?"
</p>

<p>
"No.  Your Mut and our Ma is the same Heavenly
Mother who blesses all the creatures of the earth."
</p>

<p>
"How then could you...." he began and broke
off.  But she understood 'how then could you have
killed the god Beast?'
</p>

<p>
"Our secret wisdom teaches," he said hurriedly,
in order to hide her confusion and his own, "that
animals are nearer to God than men, plants are nearer
to God than animals and the dust of the ground&mdash;Mother
Earth&mdash;is nearer to God than plants; a mass
of flaming dust, the sun, is the heart of the
world&mdash;God."
</p>

<p>
"Doesn't he know this?" Dio asked.
</p>

<p>
"No," Pentaur answered, guessing that she was
speaking of King Akhnaton, "if he knew he would
not desecrate the Mother."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps there is something that I, a childless
virgin, don't know either," Dio thought.
</p>

<p>
From the sanctuary of Mut they walked towards
the Temple of Amon, along the sacred road of the
Rams, huge creatures of black granite placed in
a row on either side of the pathway.  On the top
of the head between the horns that curled downwards,
each ram had the sun disc of Amon Ra, and
between the doubled up front legs a tiny mummy
of King Amenhotep, Akhnaton's father: the god-beast
was embracing the dead king, carrying him, as
it were, into eternal life.
</p>

<p>
It seemed to Dio they all looked at her as though
they would say "Decide!"
</p>

<p>
They came up to the pylon&mdash;the huge gates shaped
like a pyramid cut off at the top, with a
rainbow-coloured sun disc with rays and high posts for
flags; it stood at some distance from the Temple.
On either side of it were two granite giants, exactly
alike, representing King Tutmose the Third, Akhnaton's
great-great-grandfather, the first world-conqueror.
Wearing gods' tiaras, they were sitting on
their thrones with their arms folded in everlasting
rest, with an everlasting smile on the flat lips.  Above
them the wretched tatters of old flags fluttered on
the broken posts.  The birds nesting in the tiaras
chirruped loudly, as though laughing, and the black
faces of the giants were streaked with white.
</p>

<p>
Pentaur read aloud the hieroglyphic inscription
on the gates&mdash;the words of the god to the king:
</p>

<p>
"Rejoice, my son, who hast honoured me.  I give
thee the earth in length and breadth.  With a joyful
heart pass through it as a conqueror."
</p>

<p>
And the king's answer to the god:
</p>

<p>
"I have made Egypt the head of all nations, for
together with me it has honoured thee, god Amon on
high."
</p>

<p>
From the way Pentaur read the inscription Dio
understood that he was comparing the great ancestor
with the insignificant descendant.
</p>

<p>
Passing through the gate, and leaving the road ta
the Khonsu sanctuary on their left, they came out
into the square.  Men of all classes&mdash;beggars, slaves
and grand gentlemen&mdash;were standing there in separate
groups without speaking, as though waiting for
something, and when the town guards on duty went
past looked at them sullenly from a distance.  All
was quiet, but Dio suddenly remembered: "Rebellion!"
</p>

<p>
Someone came up to Pentaur stealthily from behind.
The man's woollen striped Canaan cloak, worn
over the Egyptian white robe, his reddish goat's
beard, the curly hair hanging down his cheeks, the
prominent ears, hooked nose, thick lips and the hot
glitter in his eyes, made Dio recognize him at once
for a Jew.
</p>

<p>
Pentaur whispered something in his ear; the man
nodded silently, glanced at Dio and disappeared in the
crowd.
</p>

<p>
"Who is this?" Dio asked.
</p>

<p>
"Issachar, son of Hamuel, a Jewish priest of Amon."
</p>

<p>
"But how can an unclean Jew be a priest?"
</p>

<p>
"He is a Jew on his father's side, but an Egyptian
on his mother's.  Their prophet, Moses, was also a
priest in Heliopolis."
</p>

<p>
"But why is he not shaven?"
</p>

<p>
Dio knew that all Egyptian priests shaved their
heads.
</p>

<p>
"He is hiding from the king's spies," Pentaur
answered.
</p>

<p>
"What did you speak to him about?"
</p>

<p>
"About your meeting Ptamose."
</p>

<p>
They came to the western gates of Amon's temple;
the leaf gold that covered them glowed like fire in
the light of the setting sun.  Three words had been
inscribed on them in hieroglyphics of dark bronze:
"Amon, great spirit."  The word Amon was effaced,
but that made the other two words glorify the
Unutterable the more.
</p>

<p>
Guards were standing by the closed and sealed
gates.  People going past knelt down and kissed the
dust of the holy flagstones, praying in a whisper;
they would be thrown into prison for calling on the
name of Amon aloud.
</p>

<p>
Dio showed the chief of the guards the ring with
Tutankhaton's seal and he let her and Pentaur
through the side door of the gates.
</p>

<p>
They entered the inner court that had rows of
such gigantic columns, shaped like sheaves of papyrus,
that it was hard to believe they were the work
of human hands: it seemed as though the Great
Spirit had piled up these everlasting stones as a
mute praise to himself, the Unutterable.
</p>

<p>
From the yard they came into a covered antechamber,
where the daylight came sparsely from
narrow windows right under the ceiling.  There was
sunshine in the yard, but here it was half dark
already and the thick forest of columns, saturated
with the fragrance of incense like a real forest smelling
of resin, seemed all the more huge in the twilight.
And it was quiet as in a forest; only up at the top
one could hear a faint tapping that sounded like
woodpeckers.  "Knock-Knock-Knock!"&mdash;and there
was stillness, and then again: "Knock-knock-knock!"
</p>

<p>
Dio raised her eyes and saw masons hung up in
hammocks on long strings, like spiders on cobwebs,
hammering on the walls and the pillars up above.
</p>

<p>
"What are they doing?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"Effacing Amon's name," Pentaur answered with
a smile.  Dio smiled, too; the knocking seemed to her
absurd: how could one efface the name of the
Unutterable?
</p>

<p>
As they went further into the temple the walls
narrowed down, the ceilings grew lower, darker and
more menacing, and at last an almost complete
darkness enveloped them; only somewhere in the far
distance a lamp was burning dimly.  That was the
Holy of Holies&mdash;Sehem, the tabernacle, cut out in
a block of red granite, where in the old days a
golden statuette of god Amon, a foot high, had
been kept behind linen draperies&mdash;the sails of the
holy boat.  Now Sehem was empty.
</p>

<p>
A narrow passage led from it to another tabernacle
where in the past Amon's great Ram, the sacred
Animal&mdash;the living heart of the temple&mdash;lay on a
couch of purple in clouds of the ever-burning incense.
But now this tabernacle too was empty; people said
that a dead dog's bones had been thrown into it to
defile the holy place.
</p>

<p>
"He does not know God's darkness either?" Dio asked.
</p>

<p>
"No," Pentaur answered, understanding again that
'<i>he</i>' meant the king.  "He knows that God is light,
but he does not know that darkness and light go
together...."
</p>

<p>
He knelt down and Dio knelt beside him; he began
to pray and she repeated after him:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Glory to thee, who dwellest in darkness,<br>
  Amon, the Hidden,<br>
  Lord of the silent,<br>
  Help of the humble,<br>
  Saviour of those in hell!<br>
  When they cry aloud to thee,<br>
  Thou comest to them from afar,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou sayest to them 'I am here!'"<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
They bowed down to the ground and Dio felt that
the hair on her head moved with awe: 'He is here!'
</p>

<p>
They left the temple through the eastern gates
where the litter was waiting for them.  They got
into it and were carried to the small temple
Gem-Aton&mdash;Sun's Radiance&mdash;which had only just been
built by King Akhnaton.
</p>

<p>
It had taken a thousand years to build Amon's
temple of huge blocks of rock, and this one had been
built quickly of small stones; Amon's temple was
dark and mysterious, and this one was all open
and sunny.  There were no divine images in it except
Aton's disc, with rays like hands descending from it.
</p>

<p>
They entered one of the porticos, on the wall of
which there was a bas-relief of King Akhnaton
making a sacrifice to the Sun god.
</p>

<p>
Dio looked at it dumb foundered.  Who was it?
What was it?  A human being?  No, it was some
unearthly creature in human form.  Neither a man
nor a woman, neither an old man nor a child; a
eunuch, a decrepit still-born baby.  The arms and
legs were so thin that they seemed to be nothing but
bone; narrow childish shoulders and wide, well-covered
hips; a big belly; a huge head shaped like a
vegetable-marrow, bent down under its own weight
on a long thin neck, flexible like the stem of a flower;
a receding forehead, a drooping chin, a fixed stare
and the smile of a madman.
</p>

<p>
Dio gazed at this face, trying in vain to recall
something.  All of a sudden she remembered.
</p>

<p>
In the Charuk Palace near Thebes, where Akhnaton
was born and spent his childhood, she had seen
his sculptured head: a boy looking like a girl; an
oval, egg-shaped face, childishly, girlishly charming,
quiet and gentle as that of the god whose name is
Quiet-Heart.
</p>

<p>
A man dreams sometimes a dream of paradise, as
though his soul returned to its heavenly home; and
long after waking he refuses to believe that it had
only been a dream and is full of sadness and yearning.
Such was the sadness in that face.  The drooping
eyelids were heavy as though with sleep, the
long eye-lashes seemed wet with tears and the lips
wore a smile&mdash;a trace of paradise&mdash;heavenly joy
through earthly sadness, like sunshine through a
cloud.
</p>

<p>
"Can it be the same face?" Dio wondered.  As in
delirium the beautiful face was distorted, grown
decrepit and monstrous, and, most awful of all, one
could still see that young face in this changed one.
</p>

<p>
"Well, don't you know him?" Pentaur whispered.
There was horror in his voice and mockery,
too&mdash;triumph over an enemy.  "No, he is not easy to
recognize.  But it is he, Joy of the Sun, Akhnaton!"
</p>

<p>
"How did they dare insult him like this!" Dio
cried out.
</p>

<p>
"No one would have dared if he had not asked
for it himself.  It is he who teaches painters not
to lie, not to flatter.  'Living in Truth'&mdash;Ankh-em-Maat&mdash;so
he calls himself, and this is what truth
is; he did not want to be a man, so this is what
he has become!"
</p>

<p>
"No, that's not it, that's not it!" a voice said
behind Dio.
</p>

<p>
She turned round and recognized Issachar, son
of Hamuel.  "No, that's not it.  The deception is
worse and more subtle!" he said looking at the face
of the bas-relief.
</p>

<p>
"What deception?" Dio asked.
</p>

<p>
"Why, this: listen to the prophecy.  'As many were
astonied at Him: His visage was so marred more
than any man, and his form more than the sons
of men.  And we hid our faces from Him.  But
He has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows.
The chastisement of our peace was upon Him: and
with His stripes we are healed.'  Do you know of
whom this has been said? ... And who is this man?
Accursed, accursed, accursed is the deceiver who
said 'I am the Son'!"
</p>

<p>
Slowly, as though with an effort, he averted his
eyes from the bas-relief and looking at Dio bent
down to whisper in her ear:
</p>

<p>
"The high priest of Amon expects you to-day at
the third hour after sunset."  And covering his head
with his cloak he walked out of the temple.
</p>

<p>
For a few minutes Dio stood as though spellbound.
She was so lost in thought that she did not hear
Pentaur call her twice and when he gently touched
her hand, she started.
</p>

<p>
"What is it?  What are you thinking of?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"I hardly know myself..." she answered, with
a shy, as it were, guilty smile, and then added, after
a pause:
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps we don't any of us know the most
important thing about him...."
</p>

<p>
She paused again and then cried with such agony
that Pentaur thought she was like one dying of
thirst and asking for water:
</p>

<p>
"Oh, if I only knew, if I only knew who he is!"
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p class="dropcap">
Tutankhaton had spread a rumour
that he was the son of King Amenhotep
IV, Akhnaton's father.  Tuta's
mother, Meritra, was one of the
king's concubines for a day&mdash;he had
numbers of such.  Gossips said,
however, that Tuta's father was not the king, but
the king's namesake, Amenhotep, the chief of the
Surveying Office.  Thanks to his mother, Tuta had
obtained, as a child, the rank of the prince's
play-fellow, and he rapidly made a career: royal
chamberlain, chief fan-bearer on the right hand of the
divine and gracious king, treasurer of the king's
household, bread-giver of the Two Kingdoms,
defender of Aton's faith and, finally, the king's
son-in-law, husband of Ankhsenbatona, Akhnaton's
twelve-year-old daughter.
</p>

<p>
No one could look up to heaven as devoutly as he
did, whispering in a honeyed voice:
</p>

<p>
"Oh, how salutary is your teaching, kind Uaenra,
the only Son of the Sun!"
</p>

<p>
Or compose such pious inscriptions for tombs:
"Akhnaton, the Son of the Sun, rose early in the
morning to lighten me with his light for I was
zealous in carrying out his words," said one of those
inscriptions.  "I have followed thee, O Lord
Aton&mdash;Akhnaton!" said another.
</p>

<p>
This identification of the king with God seemed
absurd and blasphemous, since everyone knew that
Aton was the Father and the king the son.  But when
it was known that these words expressed the king's
secret doctrine about the perfect unity of the Father
and the Son, people marvelled at Tuta's cunning.
</p>

<p>
The courtiers vied with one another in trying to
revile the old god Amon.  But Tuta surpassed them
all: he ordered for himself a pair of plaited sandals
made of golden straps, with Amon's face on the
soles so as to tread on the unholy one with every
step he took.  And everyone marvelled again&mdash;they
understood that he would go far in those sandals.
</p>

<p>
Tuta had been sent to Thebes with the title of
Viceroy to carry out the decrees about taking away
burial grounds from the priests and desecrating the
god Khonsu, Amon's Son.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
When Dio came to the Viceroy's white house the
old servant, who knew her, met her with low bows
and wanted to tell His Highness at once about her.
But hearing that Tuta was having lunch with the
chief of the Lybian mercenaries, Menheperra, a
man whom she disliked, she said she would wait and
going into an inner room, lay down on a low
day-couch.  Watching the slanting pink oblongs cast by
the setting sun on the white ceiling through the long
narrow slits of windows high up on the wall she
sank into deep thought, as in the antechamber of
Gem-Aton's temple: was she to go or not to go?
</p>

<p>
She grew tired of thinking and dozed.  Two big
flies were buzzing by her very ear as though
disputing "to go or not to go?"
</p>

<p>
She woke up suddenly and grasped that it was
not the buzzing of flies but a whisper, somewhere
quite close to her ear.  She looked round, but there
was no one there.  The whisper came from the next
room, which was divided off by a latticed partition
covered with a carpet; Egyptian rooms were sometimes
arranged in this way for the sake of coolness.
The speakers were probably sitting on the
matting-covered floor just by the side of Dio's couch.
</p>

<p>
"This heartburn will be the death of me," whispered
one of the voices, dignified and elderly.
</p>

<p>
"It's the goose's liver, father," answered the other
voice, high-pitched and respectful.  "Would you like
some telek?  There is nothing like it for indigestion;
with lemon and cardamon it is most refreshing."
</p>

<p>
There was a sound of liquid being poured out
</p>

<p>
"Have a drink too, Sparrow?"
</p>

<p>
"Your health, father!"
</p>

<p>
"Why do you call me 'father'?"
</p>

<p>
"Out of respect: you're my benefactor and that's
as good as a father."
</p>

<p>
"It is a good thing you respect old people.  And
why do they call you 'Sparrow'?"
</p>

<p>
"Because I pick up a grain out of every bit of
business like a sparrow out of a manure heap."
</p>

<p>
"Come now, don't be so modest about it: you
must have grabbed 'the man with the pig' from the
cemetery thieves the other day...."
</p>

<p>
Dio remembered that a man holding a pig by the
tail was the hieroglyphic of lapis-lazuli, the
Egyptian officials' favourite bribe&mdash;Hez-Bet: hez&mdash;to
hold and bet&mdash;a pig, and that the tomb of the ancient
King Saakerra had been robbed recently.
</p>

<p>
"And so I was saying, Ahmez, son of Aban, is
a foolish man and no good will come of him," the
old man's voice went on.  "You may pound a foolish
man in the mortar, but his foolishness will not leave
him, and it is better to meet a savage bear in a
field than a foolish man in the house!"
</p>

<p>
"But in what way is he foolish, father?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, because he never knows which way the
wind is blowing.  There is trouble brewing up in the
town and the Lybian soldiers are mutinous because
they haven't had their pay for the last six months.
And he, the fool, is afraid of a rising, so he was
delighted when the pay-money was sent the other
day from the king's treasury and ordered it to be
distributed straight away.  But I was too sharp for
him&mdash;I said nothing to him but kept back the money
and at once reported the whole thing to His Highness
the Viceroy.  And what do you think?  He thanked
me, said 'well done,' patted me on the cheek and
promised to get me a job in his service.  What do
you think of that now?"
</p>

<p>
"Splendid, father!  There is no one like you for
giving one a hint! ... But if there really is a rising,
it will be bad, won't it?"
</p>

<p>
"Bad for some and good for others.  A fool burns
in the fire and a clever man warms his hands at
it...."
</p>

<p>
The whisper became so low that Dio could not
hear.  Then it grew louder again:
</p>

<p>
"Impossible, impossible, father!  Who could presume
to do such a thing?"
</p>

<p>
"Do you know Issachar, son of Hamuel?"
</p>

<p>
"But he is a coward, it isn't for a dirty Jew like
him to do it!"
</p>

<p>
"He is a coward, but he can work himself up to
a frenzy.  They are all like that, the Jews: they are
cowards, but if it is anything to do with their God
they are frantic.  And it is not only he&mdash;he is merely
the knife, and the hand that holds the knife is
strong.  Soon there will be things happening to
make one dizzy, my lad."
</p>

<p>
"It is dreadful to think of, father."
</p>

<p>
"Don't be uneasy, Sparrow&mdash;you may be a falcon yet."
</p>

<p>
Dio listened with her heart beating so violently
that she was afraid they would hear it behind the
partition.  She understood that a vile and evil plot
was being hatched against the king&mdash;and she seemed
to have a share in it; perhaps that was why she
suffered so, unable to decide whether to go or to
stay.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly there was a sound of footsteps in the
next room&mdash;not in the one where they were whispering.
Both halves of the door were flung open and a
huge hunting-cat, half panther, glided in noiselessly
like a shadow; behind it, as its guard of honour,
came the runners, the fan bearers, the bodyguards,
and, last of all, walking barefoot as noiselessly as
the cat&mdash;shoes were taken off indoors&mdash;a slender
and graceful young man of medium height, with an
ordinary pleasant face.  He was wearing a plain
white robe, a smooth black wig, a broad necklace that
came half way down to his waist, and he held in
his hand a long gilded wooden staff adorned with a
golden figure of the goddess Maat&mdash;Truth.  This
was the King's son-in-law, the Viceroy of Thebes,
the real or supposed son of King Amenhotep&mdash;Tutankhaton.
</p>

<p>
He walked up to a carved ivory and ebony chair
that stood on a platform in between four pillars in
the middle of the room, and sat down.  Approaching
him Dio knelt before him.  He kissed her on the
forehead and said:
</p>

<p>
"Rejoice, my daughter!  The grace of the god
Aton be with you!  Leave us," he added, addressing
his suite.
</p>

<p>
When all had gone out of the room he moved
to the day couch and, half reclining on it, motioned
to Dio to sit down beside him; but he did it
unobtrusively so that there was no need for her to notice
the gesture unless she chose to do so.  She did not
notice it and sat down opposite him on a folding chair
with a seat of plaited leather straps.
</p>

<p>
The cat walked up to her and rubbed itself against
her legs, thrusting its head between her knees and
mewing loudly, unlike a cat.  Dio disliked cats and
especially this one: she fancied it was a huge, black,
slimy reptile.  The cat never left Tuta's side and
followed him about like a shadow.
</p>

<p>
"Why are you sitting here alone?  Why didn't
you send in your name?" he asked in a low caressing
voice that sounded like a cat purring.
</p>

<p>
"You had a visitor."
</p>

<p>
"It was only your admirer Menheperra.  Was that
why you did not come in?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, it was."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, you wild creature! ... Come here, Ruru,"
he called to the cat, "You have had enough of it?"
he asked Dio.
</p>

<p>
"No, I don't mind," Dio said politely, but she
would gladly have thrust the clinging creature away.
</p>

<p>
"It is marvellous," he said, smiling and looking at
her in the peculiar masculine way she hated: 'just
like spiders crawling about one's naked body,' she
used to say about these looks.  "One cannot get used
to you, Dio!  Each time I see you I cannot help
marvelling at your beauty....  There, forgive me, I
know you don't like it!"
</p>

<p>
The cat lifted its face and looked straight into
Dio's eyes with its fiery pupils.  She pushed it slightly
away with her foot, afraid that the cat might jump
on to her lap.
</p>

<p>
"Come now, you are being a nuisance!"  Tuta
laughed, seized the cat by its collar and, dragging it
on to the couch, made it lie down, spanked it and
said "Sleep!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, how do matters stand?  Are you coming?"
he began in a different and business-like voice.  "Stop,
wait, don't answer at once.  I am not hurrying you,
but just think: what are you doing here, what are
you waiting for?  Learning our dances?  What for?
Dance in your own way&mdash;they will like it all the
better.  Foreign things are more fashionable with us
nowadays than our own...."
</p>

<p>
"I have decided..."
</p>

<p>
"Wait a minute, let me finish.  I shall go away
and you will remain alone here and in these times
you don't know from day to day what might
happen...."
</p>

<p>
"But I am coming!"
</p>

<p>
"Are you?  Really?  You won't play me false again?"
</p>

<p>
"No, now I want to go as soon as possible."
</p>

<p>
"Why so suddenly?"
</p>

<p>
She made no answer and asked:
</p>

<p>
"Are you going to-morrow for certain?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  Why?"
</p>

<p>
"They say there may be trouble in the city."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, it's nothing.  All will be over to-morrow.
Of course it is a big town and there are many fools
about; they may want to die for their puppet and
then there is bound to be bloodshed, there is nothing
for it...."
</p>

<p>
Dio understood that puppet meant the image of
the god Khonsu.
</p>

<p>
"And does the king know it?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"Know what?"
</p>

<p>
"That there may be bloodshed."
</p>

<p>
"No, he does not know.  Why should he know?
That he might revoke the decree?  If he revoked
this one, others would still be in force.  And what is
one to do?  There is no teaching the fools without
bloodshed!"
</p>

<p>
He sat up suddenly, put his feet on the floor,
moved up to her, took her by the hand and smiled
in the ambiguous way, with a sort of wink, which,
again, there was no need for her to notice unless she
chose to.
</p>

<p>
"You know, Dio, I have long wanted to ask you,
why do you dislike me?  I have always been a friend
to you.  Tammuzadad saved you, but I, too, have
done something..."
</p>

<p>
Dio started and drew her hand away.  Tuta pretended
not to notice it and continued to smile.
</p>

<p>
"Why do you think?...." she began, and broke
off, blushing and looking down.  As always when she
was alone with him she felt stiff, awkward&mdash;as
though she had done some wrong and been caught
unawares.
</p>

<p>
"What do you want me for?" she asked suddenly,
almost rudely.
</p>

<p>
"There, you treat me as you do Ruru: I am being
nice to you and you push me away," he laughed
good-humouredly.  "What do I want you for?
Feminine charm is a great power..."
</p>

<p>
"You want to get power through me?"
</p>

<p>
"Not through you, but with you!" he said quietly
with deep emotion, looking straight into her eyes.
</p>

<p>
"And I want you because of him," he went on,
after a pause.  "He is very difficult to get on with;
you will help me: you love him and so do I&mdash;we shall
love him together...."
</p>

<p>
She understood that he was speaking of King
Akhnaton and her heart began to beat as violently as
when she was listening to the whisper behind the
partition.  She felt that she ought to say something,
but she was spell-bound as in a nightmare: she
wanted to push away the clinging reptile and could
not.
</p>

<p>
"You haven't been to see Ptamose yet, have you?"
he asked suddenly, as though they had often spoken
about it, while, as a matter of fact, they had never
exchanged a word on the subject.  Once more he
caught her unawares like a naughty little girl.
</p>

<p>
"What Ptamose?" she pretended not to understand,
but did it so badly that she was ashamed of
herself.
</p>

<p>
"Come, come!" he said, with the same winking
smile.  "I won't betray you, no one shall know of it.
And even if they did know, what of it?  I would
send you to him myself.  He is a wise old man, a
sage.  He will tell you everything; you will know
what the war is about.  Only babblers and court
flatterers imagine that we have won already.  No, it is
not so easy to conquer the old faith.  Our forefathers
were not any stupider than we are.  Amon&mdash;Aton:
is the dispute about a letter only?  No, about the
spirit.  And indeed Amon is the Great Spirit!"
</p>

<p>
When he had moved from the armchair to the
couch he had taken with him the staff with the gold
sandals strapped to it.  All of a sudden Dio bent
down, took up one of them, turned it sole upwards
and pointed with her finger to the image of Amon.
</p>

<p>
"And what have you here, prince?  'Amon the
Great Spirit'?" she asked, smiling with almost
undisguised contempt, as though she were really talking
to a 'reptile.'
</p>

<p>
"There, you have caught me!" he laughed, good-naturedly,
again.  "Ah, Dio, priestess of the Great
Mother, you are still living on your Mountain and
refuse to come down to the earth to us poor men.
And yet one day you will come down, will get your
feet muddy and bruise them against the stones and
be glad even of such sandals as these.  One must
have mercy, my friend.  Be sober and fast by
yourself, but eat with the glutton and drink with the
drunkard.  And as for the Great Spirit, I hope he
will forgive me: my sandals won't hurt him!"
</p>

<p>
He went on speaking at great length of the secret
wisdom of the chosen and the folly of the mob,
of the greatness of King Akhnaton and of his
loneliness&mdash;"he, too, does not come down to earth
from the Mountain"&mdash;of their future triple alliance
and of how he, Tuta, will help them both "to come
down."
</p>

<p>
Dio listened and the same spell came over her&mdash;she
could not awake or cry out.
</p>

<p>
"No, he is not stupid," she thought.  "Or he is
both stupid and clever, crude and subtle.  Very
strong&mdash;not he, though, but the one who is behind him.
'He is only a knife in the hand and the hand is
strong.'  He talks to me as to a child, and I expect
he talks to the king in the same way; and perhaps
he is right: we are children and he is grown up; we
are 'not quite human' and he&mdash;quite.  He is all for
the world and all the world is for him.  A man like
that is certain to reign.  You will be king over the
mice, you cat!  Akhnaton will disappear, Tutankhaton
will remain.  He will go through the ages in his
Amon's sandals, trampling on the Great Spirit.  And
the kingdom of this world will be Tuta's kingdom!"
</p>

<p>
There was a knock at the door.
</p>

<p>
"Come in," Tuta said.
</p>

<p>
The centurion of the palace guards came in and,
kneeling down, handed Tuta a letter.  He opened it
and, after reading it, said:
</p>

<p>
"A chariot!"
</p>

<p>
When the centurion went out, he got up, walked
across the room in silence, then sat down in his chair,
and resting his head on his hand, heaved a deep sigh.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, the fools, the fools!  I knew there was bound
to be bloodshed...."
</p>

<p>
"Rebellion?" Dio asked.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, there's a rising on the other side of the
river.  It seems the Lybian mercenaries have joined
the rebels."  His face was sad, but joy was shining
through the sadness.
</p>

<p>
Dio understood: the rising was the beginning and
the end was the throne.
</p>

<p>
He got up and turning to the couch took up his
staff, untied the sandals from it, put them on and
said:
</p>

<p>
"Well, there is nothing for it, let us go and put
down the rising!"

<p class="dropcap">
There will be a great rebellion and the
earth will be turned upside down
like the potter's wheel."  Recalling
these words of the ancient prophet
Ipuver, Yubra eagerly awaited the
fulfilment of the prophecy.  "What if
it begins without me!" he thought, sitting in the
pit.  And when Khnum turned him out of the
house he took a staff, slung a wallet behind his
back and set off at random, looking as though he
had been a homeless wanderer all his life.
</p>

<p>
He remembered his old friend Nebra, the boatman,
and decided to go and see him at the Risit
Harbour.  But at the harbour he was told that Nebra
had finished work and was having supper in a tavern
next door, in the Hittite Square.
</p>

<p>
Yubra was tired; his legs ached with the stocks
that he had been wearing.  He sat down to rest on a
heap of stones on the quay.
</p>

<p>
The sun was setting behind the bare yellow rocks
of the Lybian Mountains, honeycombed with tombs.
The low-lying meadows beyond the river and the
City of the Dead, where the embalmers' cauldrons
were perpetually boiling and black clouds of asphalt
smoke rose in the air, were already in shadow; only
by the funeral temple of Amenhotep, at the end of
the sacred Road of the Jackals, the golden points of
two obelisks shone with a dull glow like smouldering
candles.
</p>

<p>
The left bank was in shadow, but the right still
lay in the evening sun, which threw a coppery red
glow on the dark-skinned, naked bargemen who
carried from the boats down the planks earthenware
pots and sacks of styrax and balm from Gilead,
Arabian sandal and myrrh, fragrant incense from
Punt, and cloves&mdash;burnt offerings to the gods and
ointments for the dead.  The quay was saturated with
the fragrant odours, but through the fragrance came
the smell of a carcass thrown up by the river and
lying on the bank.  An emaciated dog, with ribs that
stood out under the skin, was devouring it.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly two white eagles pounced on the carcass
with loud flapping of wings and greedy cries.  The
dog, frightened, jumped away with a squeal, and
watched them from a distance, its tail between its
legs, its teeth bared in an angry growl, its body
shaking with hungry envy.
</p>

<p>
But a still greater envy glittered in the eyes of a
starving beggar woman, who had come in search of
food from the province of the Black Heifer, where
men were devouring each other in their hunger.
</p>

<p>
She put her wrinkled, black, charred-looking breast
to the lips of the baby perched in a wicker basket
behind her.  It was biting and chewing it furiously
with its toothless gums but could not suck out a
single drop of milk, and, no longer able to cry, it
only moaned.
</p>

<p>
"Bread, please, sir; I have had no food for three
days!" the beggar woman moaned in a voice as small
as her baby's, stretching out her hand to Yubra.
</p>

<p>
"I have none, my poor woman, forgive me," he
said, and he thought 'soon the hungry will be filled.'
</p>

<p>
He got up and walked on.  The woman followed
him at a distance as a stray dog follows a passer-by
with a kind face.
</p>

<p>
Alongside of them on the smooth road, specially
made for carrying heavy weights from the harbour
to the town, some fifteen hundred convicts and
prisoners of war were dragging, by four thick cables,
something like an enormous sledge with a huge
granite statue of King Akhnaton that had just been
brought down the river.  The superintendent of
works, an old man with a stern and intelligent face,
looked like a dwarf as he stood on the knees of the
giant statue seated on its throne; he clapped his
hands, beating the measure of the song the men
were singing and sometimes he shouted at them and
waved his stick, driving all this mass of men as a
ploughman drives a pair of oxen.  In front of them
a man was watering the road with a watering can
so that the runners should not be set on fire by the
friction.
</p>

<p>
The cable, taut like a string, cut into men's shoulders
even through the felt pads; perspiration dropped
from their faces bent low over the ground; their
muscles were strained; the veins on their foreheads
were ready to burst; their bones seemed to crack with
the incredible effort.  And the giant, at rest for ever
with a gentle smile on the flat lips, was only slightly
moved from time to time.  A doleful song, accompanied
by laboured breathing, broke out like a moan
from a thousand breasts:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Heigh-ho, pull and drag, pull and drag!<br>
  Heigh-ho, step along, step along!<br>
  When we've pulled an inch or two<br>
  We'll have earned a drink of beer,<br>
  We'll have earned a loaf of bread.<br>
  On and on with steady tread!<br>
  Make the heavy burden fly.<br>
  Now, brothers, here we go!<br>
  Have another try&mdash;<br>
  Oho!<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"These, too, will not have long to suffer: the slaves
shall be set free," Yubra thought.
</p>

<p>
From the road he turned into Teshub Street.  This
part of Thebes, by the Apet Risit harbour, was
populated by the worshippers of the god Teshub&mdash;boatmen,
carpenters, rope-makers and other working people,
as well as by tradesmen and inn-keepers.
</p>

<p>
The dark grey huts, looking like wasps' nests,
made of the river mud and reeds, were so flimsy that
they came to pieces after a good rain.  But it only
rained once in two or three years and, besides, it
cost next to nothing to build such a hut afresh.  Not
only the poor, but people of moderate means, lived
in them, in accordance with the Egyptian wisdom:
our temporal home is a hut, our eternal home is the
tomb.
</p>

<p>
The walls giving on to the street had no windows,
except a little one with a movable shutter in the
front door for the porter; the name of the owner
was written over it in coloured hieroglyphics.  All
the other windows were at the back.  On the flat
roofs could be seen the conical clay granaries and
the wooden frames over the skylights, facing north,
"wind-catchers" for catching the north wind&mdash;"the
sweetest breath of the north."
</p>

<p>
The inn of Itacama the Hittite, where Nebra was
having his supper, stood at the very end of Teshub
street, not far from the Hittite Square.
</p>

<p>
Instead of a signpost there was over the door a
clay bas-relief representing a Canaan labourer sucking
beer through a reed from a jug, and an Egyptian
woman, probably a harlot or a tavern keeper, sitting
opposite him; the hieroglyphic inscription said: "He
comforts his heart with the beer Haket, Heart's
seduction."
</p>

<p>
As he was going into the tavern Yubra turned
round to the beggar woman and called to her:
</p>

<p>
"Wait a minute, my dear; I will bring you some
bread!"
</p>

<p>
But she did not hear: his voice was drowned by
the song of two tipsy scholars.  Thinking that he
was driving her away she walked off.  And the two
scholars&mdash;one long and thin, nicknamed the Decanter,
and another short and fat, the Beer-Pot, tumbled
into the tavern nearly knocking Yubra down.  Both
were bawling with all their might:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Little geese are fond of water<br>
  But to us wine is better.<br>
  We are a merry crew<br>
  Drunken scholars bold and true.<br>
  Sages may grow old with study<br>
  Our wisdom is to drink.<br>
  Give us beer, pale or ruddy<br>
  Then we have no need to think."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Yubra walked into the dark, low-pitched room
full of smoke and the smell of cooking: Itacama was
roasting a goose on a spit.  All sorts of men of
different races sat on the matting on the floor
listening to two girls playing the kinnar and the flute;
some were throwing dice, playing chess and
'fingers'&mdash;guessing the number of fingers opened and closed
very rapidly; others were eating out of earthenware
pots with their fingers&mdash;each had a washing bowl by
him&mdash;and sucking wine and beer through reeds.
</p>

<p>
When Nebra saw his friend Yubra, he came forward
to embrace him&mdash;the old men were very fond
of each other&mdash;and ordered a luxurious supper for
him: lentil broth with garlic, fried fish, sheep's
cheese, a pot of beer and a cup of pomegranate
wine&mdash;<i>shedu</i>.  As often happens in times of famine
even poor people&mdash;as though to give themselves
courage&mdash;liked being extravagant with their last
farthings.
</p>

<p>
Before sitting down to supper Yubra thought of
the beggar woman; he broke off part of a loaf and
went outside.  But she was no longer there and he
returned to Nebra disappointed.
</p>

<p>
The beggar had walked down the street and turned
the corner; she stopped there smelling newly baked
bread.  A middle-aged woman with a wrinkled, sickly
and cruel face was squatting on the ground baking
barley cakes: she did it by sticking thinly rolled-out
paste on the outside of an earthenware pot filled
with charcoal embers.
</p>

<p>
"Give me some bread, dear, I have had no food
for three days!" the beggar moaned.
</p>

<p>
The woman raised her hard eyes to her:
</p>

<p>
"Go along!  There is no end of you beggars
tramping about; one can't feed you all."
</p>

<p>
But the beggar stood still, looking at the bread
greedily.  "Give me some, please, please!" she
repeated, with frenzied, almost menacing entreaty,
and when the woman turned away to take some
dough from another pot, she suddenly bent down and
stretched out her hand.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, you plague of Canaan, you scorpion's sting,
you snake, thief, robber, may you have no coffin for
your body!" yelled the woman, striking her on the
hand.
</p>

<p>
The beggar answered back, showing her teeth as
the dog had done and retreating slowly, her eyes
still fixed greedily on the bread.
</p>

<p>
The woman picked up a stone and threw it at
her.  The stone hit the beggar on the shoulder.  She
gave a dreadful dog-like howl and ran.  The baby in
the basket began to cry, but stopped at once as though
realising that tears were of no avail now.
</p>

<p>
Running to Hittite Square, where there was the
god Teshub's old timber chapel that looked like a
log hut, she fell exhausted by a heap of sun-dried
manure bricks for fuel.  She leaned against them
sideways uncomfortably: the basket was in the way
but she had not the strength to take it off.  The
baby was so quiet that it did not seem to breathe; she
had not the courage to see whether it was asleep or
dead.
</p>

<p>
She suddenly remembered her neighbour in the
province of the Black Heifer, a twelve-year-old
child-mother who had stolen somebody else's baby, calmly
cut its throat as though it had been a lamb, fed her
own child with it and had some herself.  "That's
what I ought to have done," thought the beggar
woman.
</p>

<p>
The pain in her stomach was gnawing her like a
wild beast.  She suddenly felt weak all over, melting
with weakness as it were.  "I shall soon die," she
thought, and remembered: "may you have no coffin
for your body."  She smiled: "no coffin&mdash;no
resurrection....  Well, so be it!  Eternal death&mdash;eternal
rest..."
</p>

<p>
She, too, though in a different way than Yubra,
felt that the world had turned upside down.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
And in the tavern Yubra was whispering with his
friend:
</p>

<p>
"Has it begun?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  The other side of the River people are
assembling already and walking about with the holy
tabernacle, singing glory to Amon.  And I expect
it won't be long before they start here," Nebra
answered, and added, after a pause: "But what is
it to us?  The rebellion is about their god&mdash;not ours."
</p>

<p>
"Never mind," Yubra said.  "Whichever way it
begins, the end will be the same: the earth will turn
upside down&mdash;and glory be to Aton!"
</p>

<p>
"Don't talk so loud, brother&mdash;if they heard you
they would give you a beating."
</p>

<p>
"No danger of that!" a stupid looking youth said,
with a grin, lisping as though his tongue were too
big for his mouth; he was Zia, the Carpenter,
nicknamed the Flea.  "It is all one to us&mdash;Amon or Aton.
So long as bread is cheaper than fish let the rest go
hang!"
</p>

<p>
"You are a stupid man, Flea!" said the cauldron
maker, Min, a sullen and pompous old man, with
colorless eyes that looked very light in his face black
with soot.  "Who is Amon's son, Khonsu?  Why,
Osiris-Bata&mdash;the Spirit of Bread.  If the Spirit
leaves the earth, there will be no more bread and
we will all perish like midges!"
</p>

<p>
"And is it true, mates," the Flea lisped, "that our
dear golden Khonsu is to be melted into money to
buy bread for the poor?"
</p>

<p>
"What is heavier than lead and what name has it,
other than foolishness?" said Decanter, the scholar,
looking at him with the self importance of a learned
man.
</p>

<p>
"And are you going to eat that bread?" Min asked,
also looking at Flea with contempt.
</p>

<p>
"I?  It's all one to me!  I will do what everybody
else does," he answered, smiling cautiously and
shrugging his shoulders.
</p>

<p>
"Everybody will eat it, everybody!" the consumptive
little cobbler Mar said hurriedly, waving
his hands and coughing.  "The pig gulps down a
baby and doesn't care&mdash;it goes on grunting just the
same; and so the people will eat the god and say
'that's not enough, give us some more'!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, we shall indeed be scoundrels if we give
away the holy image of god to be defiled!" cried a
giant with the face of a child&mdash;Hafra, the blacksmith,
striking his right fist on his left palm.
</p>

<p>
"There is one thing I can't make out," Min, the
cauldron-maker said, sighing heavily.  "We are told
that the king is a god.  How can one god rise
against another?"
</p>

<p>
"It's not the king, but the high and mighty gentry,
greedy bloodsuckers!" the cobbler again put in
hurriedly, going off into a fit of coughing.  He
brought up some blood and went on:
</p>

<p>
"They ought to be hanged, the lot of them, like
salt fish, on one string.  And the chief mischief
maker is Tuta, the purring cat&mdash;he ought to be the
first to be hanged!"
</p>

<p>
"Mice burying the cat," said Min, smiling bitterly.
"No, my man, there's no way of doing it.  The
gentry talk and the people are mute; he who has the
sword has the word."
</p>

<p>
"A knife may be as good, but the trouble is that
the hare has the knife in its paw but cannot move for
awe!  That's why the fat-bellied ride rough-shod
over us.  And if we weren't a set of fools we might
do great things at a time like this!" said a short,
thick-set, broad-shouldered man of forty, with a
terribly disfigured but calm and intelligent face, who
had been playing dice without taking part in the
conversation.  He was Kiki the Noseless, the thief
who had lately plundered the tomb of the ancient
King Saakerra and obtained thousands of pounds
worth of leaf gold and precious stones off the king's
mummy.  He had been seized and brought to trial,
but acquitted for a large bribe.
</p>

<p>
Kiki was an assumed name and no one knew what
his real name was.  It was rumored that in his
youth he had committed an awful crime; he was
punished by being buried up to his neck in the
ground, but by a miracle he escaped and ran away;
then he became the chief of a robber band in the
marshes of the Delta, was caught, had his nose cut
off by the hangman and was deported to the gold
mines in Nubia; he escaped and became a brigand
once more; was seized again and sent to the copper
mines of Sinai, escaped again and, after hiding for
some time, appeared in Thebes just before the mutiny
under the name of Noseless Kiki.
</p>

<p>
As soon as he spoke everyone was silent and turned
to him.  But he went on playing dice, looking as
though all that was being said here were empty
babble.
</p>

<p>
The musicians who had stopped for a moment
began strumming the kinnar and playing the pipe
again.  The scholars struck up a drunken song.  It
had grown dark.  They lighted a copper lamp
suspended from the ceiling and filled with evil smelling
vegetable oil, and on the floor earthenware lamps
with mutton fat.
</p>

<p>
"Zen is speaking, Zen is speaking!  Listen!"
voices were heard suddenly.
</p>

<p>
Zen&mdash;or Zennofer&mdash;a man of thirty with a sad,
gentle and sickly face and dreadful cataract on his
blind eyes, was a junior priest 'uab' in the sanctuary
of the god Khonsu-Osiris.  He was reputed to be
a seer because he knew by heart the writings of the
ancient prophets and himself had visions and heard
voices.
</p>

<p>
The musicians were told to stop, the drunken
scholars were pushed out into the street and in the
stillness that followed the gentle voice of the prophet
sounded as though coming from a distance.
</p>

<p>
"To whom shall I tell of my sorrow?  Whom
shall I call to weep?" he spoke as though crying in
his sleep.  "They do not hear, they do not see, they
walk in darkness; the foundations of the earth are
shaking and there is no wise man to understand and
no foolish man to bewail it!"
</p>

<p>
Suddenly he stretched out his arms and cried in a
loud voice: "So it has been and so it shall be, so it
has been and so it shall be!  There shall be endless
evil.  The gods will grow weary of men; the gods
will forsake the earth and go to heaven.  The sun
will be darkened, the earth will be waste.  The flowers
of the fields will set up a moan, the heart of the
beasts will weep for men; but men will not weep&mdash;they
will laugh with sorrow.  An old man will say 'I
would I were dead,' and the child 'That I had not
been born!'  There will be a great mutiny throughout
the earth.  The towns will say 'let us drive out
the rulers!'  The mob will rush into the courts of
judgment; the scrolls of the law will be torn, records
of estates scattered, the boundaries between fields
wiped out, the frontier posts knocked down.  Men
will say 'nothing is private, all things are in common;
other people's things are mine; I take what I like!'  The
poor will say to the rich, 'Thief, give me back
what you have stolen from me.'  The small will say
to the great 'all are equal!'  Those who have not
built the houses will live in them; those who have not
tilled the land will fill the granaries; those who have
not woven will be clothed in fine raiment, and she
who looked at her own reflection in water will now
gaze at herself in a mirror.  Slaves will wear gold,
pearls and lapis-lazuli, and the mistress will go in
rags, begging for bread.  The beggars will be as gods
and the earth will turn upside down as does a
potter's wheel!"
</p>

<p>
Suddenly he stood up and fell on his knees, raising
his blind eyes to the sky as though he already saw the
things of which he was speaking.
</p>

<p>
"So it has been and so it shall be&mdash;there shall be
a new heaven and a new earth.  There the lion shall
lie down with the lamb and the sucking child shall
play on the hole of the asp and the weaned child
put his hand on the cockatrice's den.  Blessed is He
that cometh in the name of the Lord!  He will come
down like rain on a freshly mown meadow, like dew
upon the parched fields.  Lo, He cometh!"
</p>

<p>
He stopped and all were silent.  "That's all nonsense,"
the Noseless Kiki's voice was suddenly heard
in the stillness.  "Why do you listen to a fool's
talk?"
</p>

<p>
"And why do you revile God's prophet, you dog?"
said Hafra the blacksmith, laying his hand on
Kiki's shoulder so heavily that Kiki staggered.
Freeing himself with an agile movement, he seized the
knife that hung at his waist; but glancing at the
giant's childish face he evidently changed his mind
and said calmly, with a twinkle in his eye,
</p>

<p>
"Very well, if he is a prophet, let him tell us when
this is to be?"
</p>

<p>
"For such as you&mdash;never; but for the saints&mdash;soon!"
Zen answered.
</p>

<p>
"Soon?  You are wrong there.  No, brother, it
will take a good long time for fools to grow wise."
</p>

<p>
"But do you know when it shall be?" Hafra asked.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I do."
</p>

<p>
"Tell us then, don't beat about the bush!"
</p>

<p>
"Do you remember the inscription on King Una's
tomb?" asked Kiki, the same mocking smile in his
eyes.
</p>

<p>
Zen said nothing, as though he had not heard the
question, but his face quivered like the face of a
child in a fit of terror.
</p>

<p>
Yubra, too, was trembling: he felt that the fate
of the world were being decided by this argument
between the saint and the criminal.  The blacksmith
scowled more and more menacingly.
</p>

<p>
"You have forgotten?  Well, I'll remind you,"
Kiki went on.  "Once upon a time, very long ago,
there lived a king called Una.  He was a clever man,
cleverer than anybody in the world, but he was a
brigand, a thief, a scoundrel, no better than we are.
He died and was buried and they put over his tomb
the inscription he told them to write: The bones of
the earth are cracking, the sky is shaking, the stars
are falling, the gods are trembling: King Una, the
devourer of gods comes forth from his tomb and
goes hunting; he sets traps and catches the gods; he
kills them; stews them, roasts them, and eats
them; big ones for breakfast, middle-sized for
dinner, little ones for supper, and old gods
and goddesses he uses to make fragrant incense.
He devoured them all and became the god of
gods.'"
</p>

<p>
"What rubbish is this, you fool?  Speak straight,
don't wriggle!" cried Hafra, clenching his fists in a
fury.
</p>

<p>
"Have it straight, then: it won't be soon, but the
hour will come when the poor and wretched will say
'we are no worse than King Una, the devourer of
the gods.'  Scoundrels, pickpockets, brigands, dirty
Jews, men with torn nostrils, the flogged, the
branded, the cursed will say 'we are nothing&mdash;let us
be everything!  Then the earth will turn upside down
and he will come..."
</p>

<p>
"Who is he?" Hafra asked.
</p>

<p>
"God and devil, the Blacky-whity, two gods in one!"
</p>

<p>
"Stop or I'll kill you!" the blacksmith shouted,
raising his fist.
</p>

<p>
Kiki jumped back and pulled out his knife.  There
would have been a fight but shouts came from the
street:
</p>

<p>
"They are coming!  They are coming!  They are
coming!"
</p>

<p>
"Rebellion!" the cobbler was the first to guess
what had happened and rushed to the door.  All the
others followed him.
</p>

<p>
There was a crush.  The Flea was pressed to the
wall and nearly suffocated.  Min was knocked down.
Hafra stumbled against him and fell down, too.
Kiki jumped over both and, whistling like a brigand,
shouted: "Have you got any knives?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," someone in the street shouted back.  Everyone
was running in one direction&mdash;from the Risit
Harbour to the Hittite Square.
</p>

<p>
It was dark; the moon had not yet risen; the stars
twinkled in the sky and there was the red glow of a
fire on the horizon.
</p>

<h3>
VII
</h3>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-p.png" width="138" height="134" alt="P">
</div>

<p class="dropcap">
People were crowded in the
Square.  In the vague hubbub of
voices one could distinguish at
times the phrases:
</p>

<p>
"Glory be to Amon on High!
Glory be to Khonsu, Amon's
Son!"  Suddenly there came the sound of melodious
singing, far off at first and then nearer and nearer.
The Square was lit up with the red glow of the
torches and a solemn procession appeared.
</p>

<p>
The Lybian mercenaries walked in front followed
by fan-bearers and censer-bearers; then came the
<i>horemhebs</i>&mdash;officiating priests, and finally twenty-four
senior priests&mdash;<i>neteratephs</i>, with shaven heads,
leopard skins across the shoulder and wide, stiffly
starched white skirts.  Walking twelve in a row they
carried on two poles the holy tabernacle&mdash;Userhet&mdash;a
boat of acacia wood with linen curtains like sails,
that hid a figure of Amon a foot high.  Its shadow
could be seen through the fine material in the flickering
light of the torches: but people did not dare to
look even at the shadow of the god: to see him was
to die.
</p>

<p>
A crowd followed the tabernacle, singing in a chorus:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Glory be to Amon on High<br>
  Glory to Khonsu, Amon's son!<br>
  Exalt ye them above the heavens,<br>
  Exalt ye them above the earth.<br>
  Proclaim to all their glory!<br>
  Tell men to fear the Lord<br>
  Throughout all generations,<br>
  Tell it to the great and small,<br>
  To every creature that draws breath.<br>
  To fishes and fowls of the air;<br>
  Tell those who know not and who know:<br>
  'Fear ye the Lord!'"<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Yubra sang, too, saying 'Aton' instead of 'Amon';
no one heard him in the general chorus.  And
sometimes he made a mistake, glorifying the god of his
enemies and rejoiced: he knew that where they were
going there would be no more enemies; the lion and
the lamb would lie down together and the child
would play on the hole of the asp.
</p>

<p>
The beggar woman from the province of the Black
Heifer walked by Yubra's side.  He had found her
half-dead with hunger by the heap of manure-bricks
in the Square, restored her to life and given her some
food: Nebra procured bread for her and milk for the
baby from a boatman friend of his.  When she had
eaten and seen that the baby was alive and sucking
a comforter that Yubra cleverly made for it, she
revived and followed him as a dog follows the man
who has given it food.  She followed him in the
procession, too.
</p>

<p>
He was holding her firmly and kindly by the hand,
as though he were leading this sorrowful and perishing
daughter of the earth to the new earth, to the
Comforter.  She understood but vaguely what was
going on, and not daring to look at the shadow of the
god behind the veil, simply repeated with the rest of
the crowd:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Glory be to thee, god of mercy,<br>
  The Lord of the silent,<br>
  The help of the humble,<br>
  The saviour of those in hell!<br>
  When they call unto thee<br>
  Thou comest to them from afar<br>
  Thou sayest to them 'I am here.'"<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
She, too, was in hell; perhaps He would come to
her, too, and say 'I am here,' she thought joyfully,
as though knowing that in the place where they were
going there would be no famine and the mothers
would not have to steal other people's children and
kill them like lambs in order to feed their own.
</p>

<p>
Pentaur was walking on the left in the first row
of the twelve priests, neteratephs, who carried the
tabernacle.  Yubra saw him and they looked at one
another.  "How did you come here, servant of Aton?
Are you a spy?"  Yubra read the question in Pentaur's
eyes.  "Come, there can be no spies now!  We
are all brothers," was the answer in Yubra's eyes,
and Pentaur seemed to understand&mdash;he smiled at him
like a brother.
</p>

<p>
Zen, the prophet, was also with the crowd; a little
boy was leading him by the hand.  His face was
sorrowful unto death: maybe he knew that Kiki was
right and that the earth would turn upside down only
in order that the worst might come.
</p>

<p>
After passing Coppersmiths' Street they came into
the sacred Road of the Rams.  At the very end of
it the dull red disc of the moon, cut across by the
black needle of the obelisk, like a cat's eye by the
narrowed pupil, was slowly rising behind the
sanctuary of Mut.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly the procession stopped.  The blast of
trumpets and the rattle of drums was heard in front;
arrows and stones from slings flew about with a
hissing sound: it was an ambush of the Nubian
soldiers sent against the rebels.
</p>

<p>
One arrow struck the foot of the tabernacle.  The
priests lowered it to the ground; men crowded
round it, defending the body of the god with their
own bodies.
</p>

<p>
The attack of the Nubians was so violent that the
Lybian mercenaries flinched and would have run
away had not help arrived just in time.
</p>

<p>
Kiki, with a few desperadoes like himself, had
gone from the Hittite Square to the raised road
where the workmen, who had been dragging the giant
statue of King Akhnaton during the day, had gone
to sleep, some on straw and others on the bare earth.
Kiki could not wake many of them: they slept so
heavily that if the very earth under them had caught
fire they would hardly have wakened.  But he did
rouse some three hundred by the mere cry of
'Plunder!'; leading them against the Nubians'
ambush he attacked it from behind and so won the
battle for the rebels.
</p>

<p>
The procession moved on with a song of victory:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Woe to be to thine enemies, Lord!<br>
  Their dwelling place is in darkness,<br>
  But the rest of the earth in thy light.<br>
  The sun of them that hate thee is darkened,<br>
  The sun of them that love thee is rising!"<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Reaching Amon's temple they walked past it and
turned to the right, to Khonsu's sanctuary, easily
scattering a small detachment of Midian archers on
the way.  But at the sanctuary they learned that at
the first news of mutiny the golden figure of Khonsu
had been removed and hidden in the treasury of
Amon's temple.
</p>

<p>
"Come, good people, you have been saving the
god long enough, it is time you thought about
yourselves!" Kiki the Noseless shouted to the crowd,
jumping on the empty pedestal of Khonsu's statue.
"There is nothing to be got here, Aton's rabble have
cleared the place, but on the other side of the river
in the Chanik Palace there is still plenty of stuff left.
Let's make for the river, mates!"
</p>

<p>
There arose a dispute, almost a fight, as to what
they were to do&mdash;save the god or plunder.
</p>

<p>
As Yubra listened, he grew uneasy: was this what
he had been hoping for or something utterly different?
</p>

<p>
After much wrangling the crowd divided into two:
the bigger part went to the other side of the river
with Kiki and the smaller set out towards Amon's
temple.
</p>

<p>
Pentaur led them.  Expecting another ambush they
put out the torches.  Men walked in silence, with
stern faces; they knew that perhaps they were going
to their death.  "We shall all die for Him!" Yubra
thought, with quiet joy.
</p>

<p>
When they reached the temple they saw there were
no guards there.  Two granite colossi and two
obelisks, as though keeping watch, threw black,
menacing shadows on to the square of white stone
bathed in moonlight.
</p>

<p>
Pentaur and Hafra, the blacksmith, walked up to
the temple gates; the gold, with the hieroglyphics
of dark bronze upon it, the two words 'Great Spirit,'
dimly glistened in the moonlight.
</p>

<p>
"Hack them!" Pentaur said.
</p>

<p>
Hafra raised the axe, but let it down again, not
daring to strike.  Pentaur seized the axe from him
and cried:
</p>

<p>
"Lift up your heads, oh ye gates, and be ye lift
up, ye everlasting doors, and the King of Glory shall
come in!"
</p>

<p>
He lifted the axe and struck; the ponderous echo
rolled through the empty, resonant air behind the
gates, as though the Great Spirit himself had
answered him.
</p>

<p>
"Achaeans, Achaeans, the devils!" was heard in the
crowd.
</p>

<p>
Achaeans, the half-savage mercenaries from the
North, had just arrived in Egypt to serve the king.
They had come straight to the City of the Sun, and
were hardly known at Thebes, but there were terrible
rumours about their ferocity and mad courage.
</p>

<p>
Rushing out from three ambushes at once they
surrounded the crowd on all sides, pressing it to
the walls of the temple so that escape was impossible.
And above the gates on the flat roof of the temple
copper helmets and spears were glistening, too.
Ethiopian slingers were ambushed there.  Arrows,
stones and lead fell from there like hail.
</p>

<p>
Pentaur raised his eyes and saw just above him,
in a narrow window of the temple wall, a boy of
fifteen, with a black monkey-like face, white teeth
bared like those of a beast of prey, and two feathers,
a green and a red one, stuck aslant in the black frizzy
hair.  Placing an arrow on the bowstring, he aimed
at Pentaur slowly bending a huge bow made of
rhinoceros bone.
</p>

<p>
Pentaur remembered the tame monkey on the top
of the palm tree over Khnum's house, throwing the
shells of the pods at the sleeping dancer, Miruit, and
he smiled.  He might have jumped behind the projecting
wall, but he thought "what for?  I shall be
killed anyway, and it is good to die for Him Who
has been!"
</p>

<p>
The bowstring sounded.
</p>

<p>
"Has been or will be?" he had time to ask and to
answer: "Has been, is and will be," while the arrow
whistled through the air.  Its copper sting pierced
him just under the left breast.  He fell on the
threshold of the closed gates.  For him the gates lifted
their heads, the everlasting doors were lifted up and
the King of Glory came in.
</p>

<p>
Standing by the tabernacle Yubra was watching
the last batch of the Lybians fighting.  Suddenly
the leaden bullet from a sling struck him on the
temple.  He fell and thought he was dying.  But
a minute later he propped himself up on his elbow
and saw that the Achaean devils were hacking the
tabernacle.
</p>

<p>
The white curtains flapped like broken wings laying
bare the small, worm-eaten, wooden figure of the
god, blackened with the smoke of incense, polished
with the kisses of the worshippers.  A soldier seized
it, and lifting it up, flung it upon the ground and
trampled it underfoot.  The god's body cracked like
a crushed insect.
</p>

<p>
Yubra fell upon his face so as not to see.
</p>

<p>
Pentaur was dying happily.  Some one gentle as
the god whose name is Quiet-Heart was bending
over him&mdash;he could not tell whether it was a boy
who looked like a girl or a girl who looked like a
boy.  He wanted to ask 'Who are you?' when the
kiss of eternity sealed his lips.  And the dulcet chords
played on:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Death is now to me like sweetest myrrh,<br>
  Death is now to me like healing,<br>
  Death is now to me like refreshing rain,<br>
  Death is now to me like a home to an exile!"<br>
</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">
When Dio had set out to see
Ptamose the mutiny was just beginning
beyond the river and all was
quiet on this side.
</p>

<p>
Issachar was waiting for her
by the Eastern Gates of the
Apet-Oisit wall, where the deserted tomb-sanctuary
of King Tutmose the Third lay in ruins.  Stepping
out of the litter and telling the bearers to wait
for her at the gate, she went with Issachar into the
half-destroyed porch of the sanctuary.  Walking up
to the wall, which was completely covered with
bas-reliefs and mural paintings, he leaned his shoulder
against it.  A movable stone turned on its axis,
revealing a dark narrow opening.  They both squeezed
themselves sideways through it and descended some
steep steps cut in the thickness of the rock.  Issachar
walked in front of Dio down a slanting underground
passage, carrying a torch.
</p>

<p>
It was close: the depths of the earth warmed
through by the eternal Egyptian sun, never cooled;
the darkness was filled with warmth.  "Glory be to
thee who dwelleth in darkness, O Lord!" Dio
remembered.  It seemed to her that here the dead were as
warm lying in their tombs in the bosom of the earth
as a child in its mother's womb.
</p>

<p>
The endless mural paintings represented the journey
of the Sun-god down the subterranean Nile: the
sail of the boat hung limply in the breathless stillness
and the dead oarsmen were dragging it over dry land
through the twelve caves&mdash;the twelve hours of the
night, from the eternal night to the eternal morn.
</p>

<p>
The hieroglyphic inscriptions glorified the Midnight
Sun, Amon the Hidden.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "When thou descendest beyond the sky<br>
  The most secret of secret Gods,<br>
  Thou bringest light to them who are in death.<br>
  Glorifying thee from within their tombs,<br>
  The dead lift up their arms<br>
  And those under the earth rejoice."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The main passage was intersected by side passages.
Suddenly the red flame of torches and the black
shadows of men carrying spears, swords, bows and
arrows flitted across them.
</p>

<p>
"Where are they carrying the arms?" Dio asked.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know," Issachar answered reluctantly.
</p>

<p>
"It must be the rebels in the town," she guessed.
</p>

<p>
Supplies of arms and also of gold, silver and
lapis-lazuli&mdash;remnants of the temple treasuries concealed
from the king's spies were hidden in these subterranean
recesses of Amon's temple.  It was all kept there
for the day of rebellion against the apostate king.
</p>

<p>
Turning into one of the side passages and walking
to the end of it, they stopped at a closed door in the
wall.  Opening it, Issachar walked in, lit a lamp with
his torch and said, putting the lamp on the floor:
</p>

<p>
"Wait here, they will come for you."
</p>

<p>
"And where are you going?" Dio asked.
</p>

<p>
"To fetch Pentaur."
</p>

<p>
"Good, bring him here!" she said joyfully: she had
been thinking about him all the time.
</p>

<p>
Issachar went out, closing the door after him.
</p>

<p>
Dio looked round the empty vaulted cell, long and
narrow like the tomb&mdash;and perhaps indeed it was one.
The walls were covered from top to bottom with
hieroglyphic script and pictures.
</p>

<p>
She sat on the floor and waited.  Tired of sitting
still she got up and, taking the lamp, began looking
at the mural paintings and reading the hieroglyphics.
She was so absorbed in this that she did not notice
the passage of time.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly the flame grew dim, gave a last flicker
and went out.  Walls of stifling, black, and, as it
were, tangible darkness, closed in upon her.  She was
afraid of being left and forgotten in this coffin.
</p>

<p>
She fumbled her way to the door and began knocking
and calling.  She listened: a deadly stillness.  She
felt more frightened than ever.  All of a sudden she
recalled Pentaur and the fear left her: if he was
alive he would come.
</p>

<p>
She sat down again, leaning her back against the
wall and remained so.  A strange stillness came over
her; she did not know whether it was dream or
waking.  She was filled with the black, warm,
sunny darkness as a vessel is with water.  With
quiet ecstasy she whispered the words she had just
read in the hieroglyphic inscriptions, spoken by the
dead man to the Midnight Sun, the hidden god:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "He is&mdash;I am; I am&mdash;He is."<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
And it seemed to her that she herself were dead and
lying in the bosom of the earth like a child in its
mother's womb, waiting for resurrection&mdash;birth into
eternal life.  And the dulcet harpstrings sang
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Death is now to me like sweetest myrrh...."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
All of a sudden a light flashed into her eyes.  A
bent, decrepit old man with a torch&mdash;a priest, to
judge by his shaven head and the leopard skin
thrown over his shoulder&mdash;stooping over her, took
her by the hand, helped her up and led her out of
the room.
</p>

<p>
"Who are you?  Where are you taking me?"
she asked.  He said nothing and was about to lead
her down some more steep narrow stairs.
</p>

<p>
"No, I don't want to go down," she said.  "Take
me up.  Where is Pentaur? .... Why do you say
nothing?  Speak."
</p>

<p>
The old man made an inarticulate sound and,
opening his mouth, showed her a stump in place of
a tongue; he explained by signs that Pentaur would
come down too and that somebody was expecting
her.  She understood that he meant Ptamose.
</p>

<p>
They walked further down.  Again Dio did not
know whether she was asleep or awake.  The dumb
man had such a dead face that it seemed to her Death
itself was leading her to the kingdom of death.
</p>

<p>
They stopped at a closed door.  The dumb man
knocked.  Someone from within asked "Who is
there?" and when Dio said her name the door was
opened.
</p>

<p>
In a low sepulchral chamber or sanctuary,
supported by four quadrangular columns, cut out in
the thickness of the rock, stood a sepulchral couch,
with a mummy in a white shroud lying on it.  There
was, Dio thought, something terrible in its face&mdash;more
terrible than death.
</p>

<p>
Her dumb guide took her past the couch into the
depths of the chamber, where a vaulted niche, lined
with leaf-copper, glowed, like sunset, in the light of
innumerable lamps.  There, in the smoke of fragrant
incense, a huge black lop-eared Lybian ram&mdash;probably
transferred from the upper temple&mdash;lay asleep
on a couch of purple.  This was the sacred animal,
"the bleating prophet," the living heart of the
temple.
</p>

<p>
A girl of thirteen&mdash;not an Egyptian to judge by
her fair hair and skin&mdash;lay beside it, with her head
on the animal's back and her eyes half-closed, like
a bride on the bed of love.  Completely naked, but
for a narrow girdle of precious stones below the
navel, shameless and innocent, she stretched herself
out, pale and white on the black fleece, like a
narcissus, the flower of death.  She was one of the
twelve priestesses of the god Ram&mdash;Amon-Ra.
</p>

<p>
At the approach of Dio, the little girl opened her
eyes and looked at her intently.  There was
something so mournful in that look that Dio's heart was
wrung; she remembered another victim of the god
Beast&mdash;Pasiphae-Eoia.
</p>

<p>
Her dumb guide prostrated himself before the
Ram.  A young priest, with an austere meagre face,
kneeling next to Dio, was burning fragrant incense
in a censer.
</p>

<p>
"Bow down to the god!" he whispered, looking
at her severely.
</p>

<p>
Dio looked at him, too, but said nothing and did
not bow to the beast, though she knew it was
dangerous&mdash;they might kill her for impiety.
</p>

<p>
When the girl opened her eyes and moved the
Ram woke up and also moved slowly and heavily:
one could see it was very old, almost at its last gasp.
It opened one eye: the pupil, fiery-yellow like a
carbuncle, glowed menacingly from under a dark heavy
eyelid, with grey lashes, and looked into her eyes
with an almost human look.
</p>

<p>
"The god opens his eye, the sun, and there is light
in the world," the priest whispered the prayer.
</p>

<p>
When he had finished he got up, and taking Dio
by the hand led her to the couch with the mummy.
He bent down to the dead man and whispered something
in his ear.  Dio drew back horrified: the dead
man opened his eyes.
</p>

<p>
His deathly, skeleton-like body, brown as a
withered tree, showed through the transparent white
of the winding sheet.  The veins on the shrunken
temples stood out as though stripped of flesh; the
thin, thread-like lips of the sunk-in mouth and the
gristle of the hooked nose&mdash;a vulture's beak&mdash;looked
deathly under the tightly drawn shiny skin.  But
living, young, immortal eyes seemed to have been
set in that mask of death.
</p>

<p>
The priest reverently lifted the mummy and
raised its head on the couch.  The dead lips opened
and whispered, rustling like dry leaves.
</p>

<p>
"Listen, the Urma is speaking to you."
</p>

<p>
It was only then Dio grasped that this was the
great seer&mdash;<i>urma</i>, watcher of the secrets of heaven
and the prophet of all the gods of north and south,
the high priest of Amon, Ptamose.
</p>

<p>
He was over a hundred years old&mdash;an age not
infrequent in Egypt.  Many people thought that he
had long been dead, for during the last ten years,
ever since the apostate king began to persecute the
faith of his fathers, Ptamose had been hiding in
subterranean hiding-places and tombs; some of those
who knew him to be alive said that he would never
die, while others asserted that he had died and
risen again.
</p>

<p>
Dio knelt down and bending over the low couch
put her ear close to the whispering lips.
</p>

<p>
"You have come at last, my dear daughter!  Why
have you delayed so long?"
</p>

<p>
There was an insidious caress in his voice, a
magnetic power in his eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Pentaur has told me much about you, but one
cannot tell all about others.  Tell me yourself now."
</p>

<p>
He began asking her questions, but he seemed
to know all before she had answered him and to
read her heart as an open scroll.
</p>

<p>
"You poor, poor child!" he whispered when she
told him how Eoia and Tammuzadad had perished
through her.  "To destroy those whom you
love&mdash;that's your misery.  Do you know this?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I do."
</p>

<p>
"Mind then that you don't destroy him also."
</p>

<p>
"Whom?"
</p>

<p>
"King Akhnaton."
</p>

<p>
"Well, if I do destroy him so much the better
for you!" she said with a forced smile.
</p>

<p>
The shadow of a smile flitted in the eyes of the old
man, too.  "Do you think I am his enemy?  No;
God knows I am not lying&mdash;why should a dead man
lie?&mdash;I love him as my own soul!"
</p>

<p>
"Why then did you rise against him?"
</p>

<p>
"I rose not against him but against Him who
comes after him."
</p>

<p>
"The Son?"
</p>

<p>
"God has no Son."
</p>

<p>
"How can the Father be without the Son?"
</p>

<p>
"All are the Father's sons.  Great in His love
he gives birth to the gods and gives breath to the
baby bird inside the egg, preserves the son of a
worm, feeds the mouse in its hole and the midge
in the air.  The son of a worm is God's son, too.
Stones, plants, animals, men, gods&mdash;all are his
sons; He has no only Son.  He who has said 'I am
the Son' has killed the Father.  <i>Ua-en-ua</i>, one and
only is He and there is none other beside.  He
who says 'there are two gods' kills God.  This is
whom I have risen against&mdash;the deicide.  He will
save the world, you think?  No, He will destroy
it.  He will sacrifice himself for the world?  No,
He will sacrifice the world to himself.  Men will
love Him and hate the world.  Honey will be as
wormwood to them, light as darkness, life as death.
And they will perish.  Then they will come to us and
say 'Save us!'  And we will save them again."
</p>

<p>
"Again?  Has it all happened before?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  It has been and it will be.  Do you know
the meaning of <i>Nem-ankh</i>, eternal recurrence?
Eternity spins round and round and repeats its cycles.
All that has been in time shall be in eternity.  <i>He</i>
has been, too.  His first name was Osiris.  He came
to us but we killed Him and destroyed His work.
He wanted to make His kingdom in the land of the
living but we drove Him to the Kingdom of the
dead, Amenti, the eternal West: we gave Him that
world and kept this one for ourselves.  He will come
again and we will kill Him once more and destroy
His work.  We have conquered the world and not He."
</p>

<p>
"There is no Son and perhaps there is no Father
either?" Dio asked, looking at him defiantly.  "Tell
me the truth, don't lie: is there a God or no?"
</p>

<p>
"God is&mdash;there is no God; say what you like&mdash;it
all comes to nothing; all men's words about God
are vain."
</p>

<p>
"There now!  I have caught the thief!" Dio cried,
laughing into his face.  "I knew all along you did
not believe in God."
</p>

<p>
"Silly girl!" he said, as gently and kindly as
before, "I am dead: the dead see God.  I adjure you
by the living God, consider before you go to Him
whether there isn't truth in my words!"
</p>

<p>
"And if there is, what then?"
</p>

<p>
"Leave Him and stay with us!"
</p>

<p>
"No, even then I shall remain with Him!"
</p>

<p>
"You love Him more than the truth?"
</p>

<p>
"More."
</p>

<p>
"Go to Him, then, to the tempter, the son of
perdition, the devil!"
</p>

<p>
"It's you who are the devil!" she cried, raising
her hand as though she would strike him.
</p>

<p>
The dumb man rushed up to her, seized her by the
arm and raised a knife over her.
</p>

<p>
"Leave her alone!" Ptamose said, and the old man
drew back.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly there was a sound of bleating, low as
the weeping of a child but old and feeble: it was the
Ram.  Ptamose looked at the animal and the animal
at him and they seemed to understand each other.
</p>

<p>
"The Great One foretells woe, woe to the earth
with its bleating!" the old man exclaimed, raising
his eyes to Dio.  "Go up&mdash;you will see what He
is doing.  It has begun already and will not end
until He comes!"
</p>

<p>
Then he glanced at the dumb priest and said:
</p>

<p>
"Take her upstairs and don't molest her, you
answer for her with your life!"
</p>

<p>
He shut his eyes and again looked like one dead.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Dio was running upstairs, with one thought only
in her mind: "Where is Pentaur, what has happened
to him?"
</p>

<p>
Going out of the catacomb by the same door as
she had entered, she went past the ruins of
Tutmose's tomb and walked along the south wall of
Amon's temple.  On the white stones of the temple
square, bathed in moonlight, dead bodies lay about
as on a battlefield.  Half-savage, hyena-like dogs
were worrying them.  An emaciated looking dog,
with a blood-stained mouth, was sitting on its hind
legs howling at the moon.
</p>

<p>
Dio stopped suddenly.  The needle of the obelisk
showed black against the moonlit sky: the
hieroglyphics on the mirror-like polished surface of its
granite glorified King Akhnaton, the Joy of the Sun,
and someone was sitting hunched up against the base
of it&mdash;-dead or alive Dio could not make out.  She
came nearer and, bending down, saw a dead woman,
thin as a skeleton, stiffly pressing a dead baby to her
wrinkled, black, charred-looking breasts, as she gazed
at it with glassy eyes; her white teeth were bared as
though she were laughing.  It was the beggar woman
from the province of the Black Heifer.
</p>

<p>
Dio recalled a black granite figure she had once
seen of the goddess Isis, the Mother with her son
Horus, and it suddenly seemed to her that this dead
woman was Mother Isis herself, accursed and
killed&mdash;by whom?
</p>

<p>
"Go up, you will see what He is doing," the words
of Ptamose sounded in her ears.
</p>

<p>
She turned round at the sound of footsteps.  Issachar
came up to her.
</p>

<p>
"Where is Pentaur?  What has happened?" she
cried, and, before he had time to answer, she
understood from his face that Pentaur had been killed.
</p>

<p>
The familiar pain of inexpiable guilt, insatiable
pity pierced her heart.  "To destroy those whom
you love&mdash;that's your misery," the words of the seer
sounded in her ears again.
</p>

<p>
It took her some time to grasp what Issachar was
saying; at last she understood: they would not give
Pentaur's body to him, but perhaps they might give
it to her.
</p>

<p>
She followed him.  A cordon of sentries guarded
the approach to the gates of Amon's temple.  The
centurion recognised Dio: he had seen her at the
Viceroy's white house; he let them both through and
told the soldiers to give her Pentaur's body.
</p>

<p>
He was lying where he had been killed&mdash;by the
threshold of the western gates.  Their gold with the
hieroglyphics of dark bronze&mdash;two words 'Great
Spirit'&mdash;dimly glittered in the moonlight.
</p>

<p>
Dio knelt down, and looking into the dead man's
face, kissed him on the lips.  Their cold penetrated
down to her very heart.
</p>

<p>
"It is my doing&mdash;His doing," she thought and the
word 'He' had a double meaning for her: he&mdash;the
king, and He&mdash;the Son.

<p class="dropcap">
Dio was watching the fire beyond
the River from the flat roof of
Khnum's house.  Charuk Palace
was burning&mdash;the residence of the
Viceroy Tutankhaton.
</p>

<p>
Built of very old dry cedar and
cypress wood, it burned hotly and steadily like a
resin torch.  The bare crags of the Lybian Mountains
above it glowed as though red hot; the flames
were reflected in the river as a pillar of fire and
white smoke coiled in clouds of moonlight blue and
fiery crimson.
</p>

<p>
Khnum's servants were standing by Dio's side on
the roof.  All the faces wore the look of that
unaccountable joy which people always feel at the sight
of a fire at night.
</p>

<p>
"There, look where it has caught now!  The
women's apartments are on fire!" someone said.
</p>

<p>
"No, the prince's lodge," another answered.
</p>

<p>
"And now something in the garden is on fire, by
the very lake, it must be Aton's chapel."
</p>

<p>
"I expect it's all Kiki's doing&mdash;his handiwork!"
</p>

<p>
"The rabble will warm their hands at the fire, you
may be sure!"
</p>

<p>
"Look, mates, look, it's begun on our side, too!"
said someone joyfully, pointing to the right side of
the river, where fire broke out in two places at once.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, the dogs, they've set it ablaze from all sides!"
</p>

<p>
Khnum came up on to the roof by a steep staircase.
Two servants supported him.  He had just got
out of bed: after the trial of Yubra that afternoon
he had had a liver attack.  Nibituia and Inioteph,
his secretary, followed him.
</p>

<p>
An armchair was brought for Khnum and Nibituia
sat on a stool at his feet.  Dio came up to them
and kissed them both on the shoulders.
</p>

<p>
"Is it long since you came back from town, my
daughter?" Khnum asked her.
</p>

<p>
"I have only just returned."
</p>

<p>
"Have you heard anything?"
</p>

<p>
"The rebels have been scattered near Amon's temple,
at Oisit, but at other places they are gathering
together again, burning and plundering.  I've heard
that the Achaean mercenaries have come with Mahu,
the king's chief of the guards."
</p>

<p>
"Extraordinary!" Inioteph muttered under his
breath and shook his head with a smile.
</p>

<p>
Khnum looked at him sullenly from under his brows.
</p>

<p>
"What are you muttering?"
</p>

<p>
"Extraordinary, I say: there are plenty of loyal
troops in the town and instead of sending them
against the rebels they wait for the Achaeans!"
</p>

<p>
"Hold your tongue, silly!  You must be careful
what you say....  And where is the Viceroy?" he
turned to Dio again.
</p>

<p>
"No one knows for certain.  Some say he is on
the other side of the river and others that he has
come over to this side, with a large detachment of
Nubians."
</p>

<p>
She very nearly said 'run away' and Khnum
understood.
</p>

<p>
"Uhuh have mercy upon us!" Nibituia sighed.
"What if he falls into the brigands' hands!"
</p>

<p>
Khnum looked at the fire for some time without
speaking.
</p>

<p>
"Quite, quite, quite!  Here it is, this is the
beginning," he said, quietly, as though thinking aloud.
"According to Ipuver's prophecy 'the slaves shall
be masters, the beggars shall become new gods.'  Our
Yubra knew what he was doing, the worm: an ant
knows how far the flood will reach and build its
hill on safe ground.  He has gone to the rebels just
in time."
</p>

<p>
Dio, too, was looking at the fire and suddenly the
familiar feeling of repetition, of eternal recurrence
came over her&mdash;<i>nem-ankh</i>&mdash;'all this has been
already'; the red flame of the fire lighted from below
the bare rocks and was reflected as a red pillar in
the water in exactly the same way; white smoke
curled in clouds of moonlight-blue and fiery crimson
just like this; now as then the cold of the dead lips
penetrated her through and through&mdash;it never left
her from the moment she kissed Pentaur good-bye.
</p>

<p>
There was a sound of rapid steps on the stairs.
The centurion of the Viceroy's bodyguard, quite a
young boy, ran up to the roof.  From his dusty
helmet, torn clothes, restless eyes and trembling lips
one could see that he had just come from a serious
engagement.
</p>

<p>
"Rejoice, my lord!" he said, approaching Khnum
with a low bow, "His Highness asks me to tell
you...."
</p>

<p>
He stopped breathless with hurry.
</p>

<p>
"Is His Highness safe?" Khnum asked, looking
into the frightened face of the boy.
</p>

<p>
"Thanks be to Aton, he is safe now, but he has
been in great danger.  The riotous rabble is so
turbulent, it is terrible....  His Highness will be here
directly, he asks you to give him shelter."
</p>

<p>
"How many are coming with him?"
</p>

<p>
"Less than thirty."
</p>

<p>
"Where are the others?"
</p>

<p>
"Some have run away and others have been sent
to Mahu, the chief of the guards: His Highness has
given him the command of the city."
</p>

<p>
"Quite, quite, quite," said Khnum, shaking his
head, thoughtfully: he understood that Tuta ran
away like a coward.  "Mahu is a brave soldier and
will make short work of the rebels.  For the moment
the city is saved, though God only knows what the
end of it will be....  Well, let us go, my son, I
shall be happy to receive His Highness."
</p>

<p>
Khnum got up and went downstairs.  All followed him.
</p>

<p>
Dio and Zenra went into Dio's room on the second
storey.  Dio began to undress.  She was trembling
so that her teeth were chattering.  The cold still
penetrated her through and through.
</p>

<p>
"Why are you trembling?" Zenra asked her.
</p>

<p>
Dio made no answer and lay down on the couch.
Zenra tucked her in, kissed her and was about to go
when Dio took her hand.
</p>

<p>
"Do you know, nurse, Pentaur is killed?" she
said quietly, with apparent calm.
</p>

<p>
The old woman's legs gave way under her.  She
sat down on the edge of the couch so as not to fall.
</p>

<p>
"Good Lord!" she whispered, with the surprise
people always feel at the news of a sudden death.
"But how, where, when?"
</p>

<p>
"Just now in the riot by Amon's temple."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, poor thing!" Zenra wept.  "Such a good
man, and I had hoped..."
</p>

<p>
Dio smiled.
</p>

<p>
"You hoped he would marry me?  Yes, the bridegroom
was right enough, but the bride was no
good....  Well, go now and don't cry.  One mustn't
cry for him&mdash;he died a good death.  God grant us
all to die like that!"
</p>

<p>
Dio closed her eyes, but as soon as Zenra went
out she opened them again and looked at the other
end of the room where a moonbeam fell upon the
tall Amon's harp with crossed strings and two
rainbow-coloured sun discs at the foot; their golden
centres glittered dimly in the uncertain light.  It was
the harp on which Pentaur had played that afternoon
his quiet songs of love and death.
</p>

<p>
Whether a cloud had covered the moon or Dio's
eyes were dimmed with tears, she suddenly fancied
that somebody's shadow flitted across the slanting
square made by the moonbeams on the white wall.
"It is he," she thought, and was all alert as though
waiting for the harpstrings to sound.  But all was
silent and the shadow disappeared; the light on the
wall was once more even and white.  Dio covered her
head with the bedclothes and settled down to sleep
but she could not.
</p>

<p>
All of a sudden she heard the sound of the harp.
She threw off the coverlet, sat up and listened: the
chords were ringing and singing:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Death is now to me like sweetest myrrh,<br>
  Death is now to me like healing,<br>
  Death is now to me like refreshing rain,<br>
  Death is now to me like a home to an exile!"<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
And again a shadow flitted across the wall.  Terror
possessed her.  But the familiar pain of inexpiable
guilt, insatiable pity was stronger than terror: oh,
if she could only see his shadow, could only say to
his shadow 'forgive'!
</p>

<p>
She got up from the bed and went to the harp.
The strings continued vibrating quietly but clearly.
Something living was fluttering down below.  Dio
looked down and saw a bat that was caught in the
network of the crossed strings and was struggling
against them.
</p>

<p>
Dio smiled bitterly and regretted the terror of the
moment ago.  The wall of death rose between them
more impenetrable than ever, the dead went further
away into death, as though he had died again.
</p>

<p>
She carefully released the captive, kissed it on the
head and, climbing on to a chair, let it out of the
long and narrow window right up by the ceiling.
</p>

<p>
She returned to her bed, lay down and sank at
once into the deep heavy sleep of grief.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Get up, my dear, get up, it is time to go," she
heard Zenra's voice over her.
</p>

<p>
"To go?  Where?" she muttered without opening
her eyes.
</p>

<p>
"To the City of the Sun.  Tuta is going to-day
and we go with him.  Come, wake up, sleepy head!"
</p>

<p>
Dio opened her eyes.  The light was still dim in
the windows: the sun had not yet risen.  But a
sudden joy flooded her like sunlight.  It seemed she
had only now understood what it meant&mdash;"Akhnaton,
the Joy of the Sun!"
</p>

<p>
She dressed quickly and ran up to the roof.
</p>

<p>
The winter morning was still and misty and its
stillness seemed to say that the riot was over, the
earth had not turned upside down, but stood firmly
and would go on doing so for a long time yet.
Everything was as usual: two white turtle-doves
were cooing in the garden under the black feathery
cedar tree; the morning sounds, slightly muffled by
the fog, were wafted from afar over the water of
the canal: the braying of the donkey, the creaking
of the water-raising wheels, the clatter of the
laundry bats and the mournful droning song:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Washerman, washing clothes in the river,<br>
  Good neighbour of the crocodile swimming past"<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
As always one smelt in the morning freshness the
slightly bitter smoke of manure-bricks, like the smell
of autumn bonfires in the fields of her native north.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly a warm, rosy light shone through the
cold whiteness of the mist, like heavenly joy through
earthly sorrow.  "Heaven is united with the earth;
on earth there is the joy of heaven."  Dio recalled
the words of the Osiris mysteries.
</p>

<p>
"Joy of the Sun, Joy of the Sun&mdash;Akhnaton!" she
repeated, weeping and laughing with joy.
</p>

<p>
Zenra called to her and told her to make haste.
Dio ran downstairs to say good-bye to Khnum and
Nibituia.  Khnum gave her his blessing and kind
old Nibituia put her arms around her and wept: she
had grown to love Dio as her own daughter.
</p>

<p>
They stepped into a boat and went down the Big
Canal to the Risit Harbour where the Viceroy's boat
was waiting.  Tuta was on it already: he had gone
before daylight.
</p>

<p>
The boat had two masts; the sails with a check
pattern were spread out widely like a falcon's wings;
on the prow was the horned head of a gazelle and
on the stern a huge lotus-flower: the rudder was a
flowering shrub and its handle the head of a king in
a high tiara; the deck cabins of carved acacia wood
were arranged in two storeys, like a small palace,
magnificently painted and gilded, and fenced round
the top with a network of royal snakes standing on
their tails; coloured flags were displayed everywhere.
The whole ship was a living miracle of gold, purple
and azure, half bird, half flower.
</p>

<p>
The anchor was raised and they set off.  The sun
had risen and the mists melted away.  A fresh wind
blowing through the mountain gorges, filled the
sails; the oarsmen plied their oars and the ship
swiftly glided down the river.
</p>

<p>
Tuta did not leave his cabin all day: he had
toothache and his cheek was swollen.  The cat Ruru went
about with a bandaged paw: it had been hit with a
stone in the riot.  When at last Tuta did come out
towards evening he looked so crestfallen that Dio
thought he was just like a cat that had received a
shower bath.
</p>

<p>
Later on the wits at court composed a song about
this dismal journey.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Poor little Tuta<br>
  Moans in his cabin.<br>
  His cheek is swollen,<br>
  Toothache very bad.<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  He warmed himself that night<br>
  By the Charuk palace fire,<br>
  Then exposed his heated cheek<br>
  To a draught in terror dire.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Well, he hasn't had his way this time, but he will
the next," Dio thought.  "You will be king over the
mice, you cat."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The City of the Sun, Akhetaton, Egypt's new
Capital, was built in the province of Hares, half-way
between Memphis and Thebes, four hundred aters
or five days' journey from Thebes.
</p>

<p>
They sailed in the day-time only and spent the
nights in harbours: sailing at night was dangerous
because of the many shallows and whirlpools.  The
bed of the Nile changed continually, especially in
winter when the water was shallow.  The pilot, standing
on the ship's prow, was all the time feeling the
bottom with a pole.
</p>

<p>
They passed the big commercial harbour, Copt,
which lay on the caravan route leading through the
desert to the Red Sea; the town of Dendera, with
the great temple of Isis-Hathor; the town of Abt,
where the body of the god-man, Osiris, was buried,
and the most ancient of the Egyptian cities, Tinis,
the capital of Men, the first king of Egypt.
</p>

<p>
But the cities were few; poor villages with huts
made of the dried mud of the Nile were more frequent.
The yellow streak of dead sand and the black
streak of fertile earth&mdash;Black Earth, Kemet, was
the name of Egypt&mdash;stretched on either side of the
river, peaceful, simple and monotonous; the black
of the Nile mud, humid and shining like the living
'pupil of Isis' and the yellow of the desert&mdash;life and
death&mdash;were side by side, in an eternal union, eternal
peace.
</p>

<p>
It was winter&mdash;sowing time.  Men were ploughing,
harrowing, sowing.  Oxen slowly walked along
drawing rich furrows with the plough.  Here and
there the first crops already showed their bright
spring green.  And the melancholy singing of the
ploughman echoed far in the stillness of the fields.
</p>

<p>
The dull white waters of the Nile now flowed
fast, pressed in by rocky banks; now widened out in
pools and backwaters still as a pond, with impassable
jungles of papyrus and green carpets of floating
lotus leaves; only a hippopotamus, waddling ashore,
and a lion or a leopard, coming down to drink, cut
narrow paths in those thickets.
</p>

<p>
A long-legged ibis strode along the humid slime
measuring the ground like the wise god Tot, the
land-measurer.  Crocodiles lay on the sandbanks, like
slimy logs, and the birds benu&mdash;a kind of heron&mdash;walked
along their backs picking off the water fleas
or, fearlessly thrusting their heads into the open
jaws, cleaned the monsters' teeth.
</p>

<p>
And long after the fall of dusk, the tops of the
cliffs glowed a fiery yellow and the girlishly slender
outlines of the palms and the coal black cones of the
granaries showed black against the crimson west.
</p>

<p>
The nights were as still as the days; only the
jackals barked and howled in the desert and the
hippopotamus in the papyrus thicket bellowed, like a
bull, at the dazzlingly bright moon, the sun of the
night.
</p>

<p>
And in the morning the day-sun rose as radiant
as ever.  The two streaks&mdash;the black and the
yellow&mdash;stretched along the banks as monotonously
as before; the oxen walked along as slowly, cutting
deep furrows with the plough and the melancholy
singing of the ploughman echoed in the stillness of
the fields.
</p>

<p>
And everything was as still and gentle as the face
of the god whose name is Quiet-Heart.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
On the evening of the fifth day after passing a
rocky gorge that seemed like a dark and narrow
fortress gate, the ship suddenly came out into a
sunlit expanse of water.  One gate was in the south
and another in the north; between them, surrounded
on all sides by mountain ridges, as by fortress walls,
lay the great plain cut in two by the Nile: in the
west green meadows stretched as far as the Lybian
Hills that melted into rose and amethyst in the light
of the setting sun; in the east lay the semicircle of
rocky and sandy desert, rising gradually towards
the parched rocks of the Arabian mountains.  Between
the river and the desert there was a long and
narrow streak of palm groves and gardens.  White
houses were scattered among them like dice and a
huge white temple towered above them.
</p>

<p>
"The City of the Sun!  The City of the Sun!"  Dio
recognised it at once and with a joyous terror
she thought: "<i>He</i> is here!"
</p>

<p>
And just as when she stood by the body of
Pentaur, the word 'He' had a double meaning for
her: he&mdash;the king and He&mdash;the Son.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap0201"></a></p>

<h2>
PART II
<br><br>
WHO IS HE?
</h2>

<p><br><br></p>

<h3>
I
</h3>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-i.png" width="131" height="136" alt="I">
</div>

<p class="dropcap">
I, Akhnaton Uaenra, the Joy of
the Sun, the only Son of the Sun,
speak thus: here will I build a city
in the name of Aton, my Father,
for it was none other than He
brought me to Akhetaton, his
portion from all eternity.  There was not any man
in the whole land who led me to it, saying 'build
a city here,' but my heavenly Father has said it.
This land belongs not to a god nor to a goddess,
not to a prince nor to a princess, but only to
Aton, my Father.  May the City of God thrive
like the sun in heaven.  Behold, I raise my hand and
swear: I will not pass beyond the boundary of this
domain, which Aton has himself desired and fenced
in with his hills, and with which He is pleased for
ever and ever!"
</p>

<p>
This inscription was cut in the thickness of the
rocks, north, south, east and west of the city of
Akhetaton, on fourteen flat boundary stones, which
marked the portion of Aton, the kingdom of God
upon earth.  They were fourteen according to the
fourteen parts of the dismembered body of Osiris,
the Great Victim, for King Akhnaton was himself
the second Osiris.
</p>

<p>
In the fourth year of his reign he had abandoned
the ancient capital of Egypt, Nut Amon or Thebes,
and founded a new one.
</p>

<p>
The city was built with such haste that the newly
erected walls were showing cracks; the cracks were
patched up with clay and the building carried on.
Experienced architects merely shook their heads,
remembering the old saying: 'to build in a hurry
means no end of worry.'
</p>

<p>
The king's exchequer was growing empty; innumerable
stores of treasure, plundered from the temples
of Amon, were being spent; tens of thousands
of workmen were driven to Akhetaton from all
parts of Egypt; they worked even at night, by
torchlight.  And the miracle had taken place; within ten
years a new city had grown up in the desert; so
does the pink lotos, nekheb, break into flower during
the night and appear above the water in the morning;
so does a beautiful mirage rise over the shimmering
heat of the desert; but the water flows away
and the lotos fades; the wind blows and the mirage
is gone.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Dio came to Akhetaton five days before the great
festival, the twelfth anniversary of the city's
foundation, coinciding with the day of Aton's nativity,
the winter solstice, when the 'little sun,' the baby god
Osiris-Sokkaris, rises from the dead and is born.
She was to dance before the king for the first time
at that festival.
</p>

<p>
Tuta had intended to present her at court as soon
as they arrived, but she did not wish it and he gave
way; he gave way to her in everything, waiting upon
her wishes; it was evident that she was for him a
big stake in a big game; he was bargaining over 'the
Pearl of the Seas' like a clever merchant
</p>

<p>
He was soon comforted for his bad luck in
Thebes.  While still on the journey he received good
news from his friends at court who had done their
best for him and gave the king such a version of
the rising that Tuta's weakness appeared as mercy,
his cowardice as love of peace: he ran away from
the battlefield, they said, because he remembered that
'peace was better than war.'
</p>

<p>
Dio spent the five days before the festival in
Tuta's house near the temple of Aton, preparing for
the dance.  She did not go out nor show herself to
anyone in the daytime, but at night she went up to
the flat roof of the temple where she was to dance.
She practiced there herself and taught others.
</p>

<p>
The day before the feast she was sitting alone, late
in the evening, in the newly decorated room of
Tuta's summer house; he and his wife, the king's
daughter Ankhsenbatona, or Ankhi, lived in the
winter house.  The smell of fresh paint and plaster
came from the still unfinished part of the house,
where in the daytime masons, carpenters and painters
were at work.  It seemed to Dio that the whole
town was pervaded by this smell.
</p>

<p>
Red pillars with green garlands of palm leaves
supported the sky-blue ceiling.  The white walls were
decorated with a delicate design of yellow butterflies,
fluttering over fine seaweed.
</p>

<p>
The freshness of a winter evening came through
the long, narrow stone-trellised windows, right up
by the ceiling.  Sitting on a low couch&mdash;a brick
platform covered with rugs and cushions&mdash;Dio,
wrapped up in her Cretan wolf-fur, was warming
herself by the hearth&mdash;an earthenware platter of hot
embers.
</p>

<p>
"To-morrow I shall see <i>him</i>," she thought with
fear.  She had begun to be afraid on the very first
day she arrived, and grew more so as time went oh;
and on this last night before the meeting such fear
possessed her that she felt she might run away if
she did not control herself.  She went hot and cold
at the thought that the next day she was to dance
before the king.  "My legs will give way under me,
I shall stumble, fall flat, disgrace poor Tuta!" she
laughed, as though to make her fear worse.
</p>

<p>
In the depth of the room two sanctuary lamps
were hanging in two niches decorated with alabaster
bas-reliefs of the king on the left and the queen on
the right.  The wall space between them was covered
with rows of turquoise blue hieroglyphics on golden
yellow ground, glorifying the god Aton.
</p>

<p>
Dio got up, and going to the niche on the left,
looked at the bas-relief of the king standing at an
altar.  He was raising two round sacrificial loaves,
one on each palm, towards the Sun.  The enormously
tall royal tiara, tapering to a point, seemed too heavy
for the childish head on the slender neck, flexible
like the stem of a flower.  The childish face was
irregular, with a receding forehead and a protruding
mouth.  The charm of his naked body was like that
of a flower that had just opened and was already
fading with the heat:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Thou art the flower uprooted from the ground,<br>
  Thou art the plant unmoistened by running water."<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Dio recalled the song of weeping for the dead god
Tammuz.
</p>

<p>
The neck, the shoulders, the hands, the calves and
the ankles were slender and narrow like those of a
boy of ten, but the hips were wide like a woman's
and the breasts too full: neither he nor she&mdash;he
and she at the same time&mdash;a marvel of god-like
beauty.
</p>

<p>
On Mount Dicte in the Island of Crete, Dio had
heard an ancient legend: in the beginning man and
woman were one body with two faces; but the Lord
cut their body in two and gave to each a spinal
cord; 'that's how people cut eggs in two with a hair
for pickling,' old Mother Akakalla, the prophetess,
used to add with a queer, uncanny laugh when she
told this legend in Dio's ear.
</p>

<p>
"The hair could not have passed right through his
body," she thought, looking at the King's image,
and she recalled the prophecy: "the kingdom of God
shall come when the two shall be one, and male shall
be female and there shall be neither male nor female."
</p>

<p>
She knelt down and stretched out her arms to the
marvel of godlike charm.
</p>

<p>
"My brother, my sister, the two horned moon, the
double-edged axe, my lover, my loved one!" she
whispered devoutly.
</p>

<p>
A whiff of wind came from the window; the flame
of the lamp flickered, the outline of the figure grew
dim and through the marvel the monster peered&mdash;neither
old nor young, neither man nor woman, a
eunuch, a decrepit babe, the horror of Gem-Aton.
</p>

<p>
"Go to him then, the seducer, the son of perdition,
the devil," the voice of Ptamose sounded over her
and she buried her face in her hands, terrified.
</p>

<p>
At the same moment she felt that someone was
standing behind her; she turned round and saw a
little girl.
</p>

<p>
A robe, transparent like running water, fell in
flowing folds over the slender body.  The
over-dress had come open in front and the
amber-brown skin could be seen through the shift worn
underneath.  The girl wore on her head a huge
shiny black wig of tightly plaited tresses cut evenly
round the edge.  A tiny talc cup, turned upside down
and filled with the <i>kemi</i> ointment made up of seven
perfumes&mdash;the royal ointment&mdash;was fixed on the
top of the head.  Slowly melting with the warmth of
the body it dropped like fragrant dew on the hair,
face and clothes.  The long stem of a pink lotos
was thrust through a hole in the cup in such a way
that the half-open flower, with a sweet smell of
anise, hung over the forehead.
</p>

<p>
The girl was about twelve years old.  The childish
face was charming though irregular, with a
protruding mouth and a receding forehead; the large
slightly squinting eyes had a fixed heavy look such
as one sees in the eyes of an epileptic.
</p>

<p>
At one moment she seemed a child, at another a
woman; there was something pathetic and charming
in this elusive twilight between childhood and
womanhood.  She was a half-open bud like the rosy
lotos <i>nekheb</i> over her forehead, fragrant with the
freshness of water; it closes its petals and shortens
its stem at night as it hides under the water and
when, in the morning, it comes up again and opens
its chalice, a golden winged beetle flies out of
it&mdash;Horus, the newly-born god of the Sun.
</p>

<p>
The little girl appeared so suddenly, so like a
phantom that Dio looked at her almost in fear.  Both
were silent for a second.
</p>

<p>
"Dio?" the visitor asked at last.
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  And who are you?"
</p>

<p>
She made no answer; but raising her left eyebrow
and shrugging her shoulders, asked again:
</p>

<p>
"What were you doing here?  Praying?"
</p>

<p>
"No .... simply looking at the figure...."
</p>

<p>
"But why were you kneeling, then?"
</p>

<p>
Dio blushed in confusion.  The child lifted her
eyebrow again and shrugged her shoulders.
</p>

<p>
"You don't want to tell me?  Very well, don't."
</p>

<p>
She went up to the couch and picked up from it
the gazelle skin which she had taken off when she
came into the room.
</p>

<p>
"It is cold and damp in your room.  You don't
know how to keep a fire in," she said, wrapping
herself up.  "Well, aren't you going to say anything?
I want to talk to you."
</p>

<p>
She sat on the couch in the Egyptian fashion,
clasping her knees with her hands and resting her
chin on them.  Dio sat down beside her.
</p>

<p>
"You don't know yet who I am?" asked the child,
fixing her heavy gaze upon Dio.
</p>

<p>
"I don't."
</p>

<p>
"His wife."
</p>

<p>
"Whose wife?"
</p>

<p>
"Are you pretending, or what?"
</p>

<p>
"The princess?" Dio guessed suddenly.
</p>

<p>
"Thank heaven, at last!" said the visitor.  "Well,
why do you sit and stare at me?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, what's wrong?"
</p>

<p>
"What's wrong?  The king's daughter, a child of
the Sun, is before you and it doesn't occur to you
to make the slightest bow?"
</p>

<p>
Dio smiled and knelt before her on the couch, as a
grown up person kneels before a child to caress it.
</p>

<p>
"Rejoice, Princess Ankhsenbatona, my dear, welcome
guest!" she said with all her heart and was
about to kiss the princess's hand, when the girl
quickly drew it away.
</p>

<p>
"There, now she is grabbing my hand!  Is that the
way to bow to royalty?"
</p>

<p>
"Isn't it?"
</p>

<p>
"You should bow down to the ground!  Well, I
don't care, I don't want your bows, sit down....
Wait a minute though!"
</p>

<p>
She also knelt suddenly in front of Dio.
</p>

<p>
"Turn to the light, please; that's it!"
</p>

<p>
Dio turned her face to the lamp that stood on the
floor by the couch&mdash;a flower of blue glass on a high
alabaster stand.  Ankhi approached her face to Dio's
and with a business-like frown began to scrutinize
her in silence.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, very beautiful," she whispered at last as
though speaking to herself.  "What rouge do you
use?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't use any."
</p>

<p>
"What next?"
</p>

<p>
She licked her little finger and raising it to Dio's
face asked:
</p>

<p>
"May I try?"
</p>

<p>
"Do."
</p>

<p>
Ankhi slowly moved her finger along Dio's cheek
and looked to see if the tip of it was red.  No, it was
not red.
</p>

<p>
"Strange!" she said in surprise.  "How old are you?"
</p>

<p>
"Twenty."
</p>

<p>
"How is it you are so young?"
</p>

<p>
"But twenty isn't old, is it?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh yes, it is with us.  We are married at ten and
grandmothers at thirty.  But, of course, with you in
the north everything is different: the sun makes
people old and the cold keeps them young," she said
complacently, evidently repeating somebody else's
words.
</p>

<p>
She sat down in the same attitude as before, clasping
her knees with her hands, and sank into thought.
</p>

<p>
"Why do you laugh?" she asked, again fixing her
heavy gaze on Dio.
</p>

<p>
"I am not laughing, I am merely happy."
</p>

<p>
"What about?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know.  Simply because you have come."
</p>

<p>
"It's always 'simply' with you....  Do you
imagine I am a little girl? .... What has he said
to you about me?"
</p>

<p>
Dio understood that 'he' was Tuta.
</p>

<p>
"He said you were very clever and a beauty
and that he loved you more than anything in the
world."
</p>

<p>
"Nonsense!  You just say this out of kindness....
You must have both been laughing at me.  Has he
told you that I play dolls?"
</p>

<p>
"No, he hasn't."
</p>

<p>
"But I do play!  I played last summer and will
play again if I want to.  I don't care if they do laugh
at me.  The king says children are better than grown-ups,
wiser, they know more.  Eternity, he says, is a
child playing with, playing..."
</p>

<p>
She forgot what Eternity was playing with and
flushed crimson.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, curse the thing!  The wool has again made
my head hot."  She pulled the wig off her head and
flung it away.  The talc cup clinked against the wall;
the lotos stem broke and the flower hung down
piteously.
</p>

<p>
"Do you imagine that I have dressed up for you?
Not likely!  I am going to supper at the palace..."
</p>

<p>
Her head was shaven and had such a long, vegetable,
marrow-like skull that Dio almost cried out
with surprise.  In Egypt long heads were regarded
as particularly beautiful in girls.  The strange custom
of bandaging newborn children's heads in order to
lengthen their skulls was brought to Egypt from the
Kingdom of Mitanni, the midnight land by the
upper Euphrates, whence Akhnaton's mother, Queen
Tiy, came.  All the King's daughters were
long-headed.  Noble ladies and, later on, men suddenly
developed long skulls also: they wore special skull
caps&mdash;"royal marrows"&mdash;made of the finest antelope
skins.
</p>

<p>
Very likely Princess Ankhi took off her wig on
purpose to boast of the shape of her head to Dio:
"You may have rosy cheeks, but I have a royal
marrow!"
</p>

<p>
"And is it true you are a sorceress, they say?"
</p>

<p>
"No, it isn't."
</p>

<p>
"Then what did they want to burn you for?"
</p>

<p>
Dio said nothing.
</p>

<p>
"Again, you don't want to tell me?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't."
</p>

<p>
"You killed the god Bull, your Mreura, or was it
Hapius?"
</p>

<p>
Hapius was the bull of Memphis and Mreura the
bull of Heliopolis, the incarnate god of the Sun.
"We, too, had a Mreura," Ankhi went on, not waiting
for an answer.  "It died two years ago: I was
very fond of it.  It was old and blind.  I used to go
into its stable, put my arms round it and kiss its head,
and it would lick my face and bellow into my ear as
though to say something.  To kill a creature like
that, good heavens!  It's like killing a baby...."
</p>

<p>
She paused, and looking at Dio from under her
brows said suddenly:
</p>

<p>
"They have found a wax doll in the palace."
</p>

<p>
"What wax doll?"
</p>

<p>
"A charmed one, with its heart pierced by a needle;
the person whose name is written on the wax is
sure to die.  The king's name was written on it; they
found it in the king's bedchamber...."
</p>

<p>
She paused again and asked:
</p>

<p>
"How long have you been here?"
</p>

<p>
"Five days."
</p>

<p>
"And the wax doll was found the day before yesterday."
</p>

<p>
"Well, what of it?"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing.  One can't stop people talking and
they say all sorts of things ....  And why do you
sit at home hiding from everyone and only come
out at night?"
</p>

<p>
Her face worked suddenly, the eyes flashed angrily,
the lips trembled and she said, looking straight
at Dio:
</p>

<p>
"Are you his concubine?"
</p>

<p>
"Whose?"
</p>

<p>
"Tuta's."
</p>

<p>
Dio clasped her hands in dismay.
</p>

<p>
"What nonsense, princess darling!"
</p>

<p>
"Why nonsense?"
</p>

<p>
"Because I cannot be anybody's concubine:
priestesses of the Mother are perpetual virgins.  And,
besides it's a matter of taste.  His Highness
... may I speak the truth, you won't be angry?"
</p>

<p>
"No, speak."
</p>

<p>
"His Highness is very nice, but I don't like him
at all."
</p>

<p>
Ankhi looked at her, heaved a deep sigh, as a
person suddenly relieved of violent pain, and
whispered:
</p>

<p>
"Is it true?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, look into my eyes, don't you see it is true?"
</p>

<p>
Ankhi looked straight into her eyes; then turned
away and buried her face in her hands; her thin
shoulders quivered and all her body trembled with
silent sobs.
</p>

<p>
Dio moved up to her and putting her arms round
her pressed the girl's long shaven head&mdash;the royal
marrow&mdash;to her bosom.
</p>

<p>
"Don't you believe me?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I do.  I have known all along that it was all
untrue about your being a sorceress, and the wax
doll.  I said it all on purpose..."
</p>

<p>
"Then why are you crying?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, because I am so mean, so horrid!  I liked
you the moment I saw you and so I got angry.  I
am always angry with the people I am fond of....
But you don't know all yet!  I made old Iagu
promise&mdash;he is an old servant, a faithful dog and
loves me as his own soul&mdash;I made him promise that
he would kill you if you really were Tuta's mistress.
I would have killed him and myself, too&mdash;that's what
I am like!  When the devil gets hold of me I can
do anything...."
</p>

<p>
She wept again.
</p>

<p>
"There, there, my little darling, my sweet little
girl!" Dio whispered, stroking her head, and
suddenly she remembered she had said almost the same
words when she caressed Eoia just like that.  "That's
all over now and done with!  Let us be friends,
shall we?"
</p>

<p>
Ankhi said nothing but pressed more closely to
her.  Dio kissed her on the lips without speaking and
herself wept for joy.
</p>

<p>
Joy rose in her heart, like the sun, and the fear she
had felt melted away like a shadow.
</p>

<p>
"Darling, darling child!" she thought, "it is he
himself, Akhnaton, the Joy of the Sun, has sent you
to me as joy's messenger!"
</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">
In the silence of the night a trumpet
proclaimed joy unto men.  First
one, then another, a third&mdash;and
then scores and hundreds of
trumpets played the hymn to Aton:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Glorious is Thy rising in the East,<br>
  Lord and giver of life, Aton!<br>
  Thou sendest Thy rays and darkness flees,<br>
  All the earth is filled with joy.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The trumpets sounded at every end of the city,
arousing many-voiced echoes in the mountains.  Just
as cocks call to one another and crow to the Sun in
the night, so did the trumpets call at the hour before
dawn when men's sleep is like the sleep of death,
as is said in Aton's hymn:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Men sleep in darkness like the dead,<br>
  Their heads are wrapped up and their nostrils stopped.<br>
  Stolen are the things that are under their heads,<br>
  While they know it not.<br>
  Every lion cometh forth from his den,<br>
  Serpents creep from out of their holes,<br>
  The Creator has gone to rest and the world is mute.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
But the trumpet was waking the sleepers as the
call of the Lord will one day wake the dead.  Old
men and children, slaves and free, rich and poor,
foreigners and Egyptians, were all running to greet
the newborn sun, the god Aton.
</p>

<p>
Dio was roused by the sound of the trumpet in
the small chapel of Aton's temple where she slept
that night with the girl singers, musicians and
dancers who were to accompany her in her dance
before the king.
</p>

<p>
"The trumpets call, the trumpets!  Get up, girls!
The sun is born, rejoice!" she heard the voices round
her.
</p>

<p>
They embraced and kissed one another, wishing
each other new joy with the new sun.
</p>

<p>
They ran out on to the flat roof of the temple.
</p>

<p>
It was a warm night: after midnight the wind had
changed to the south and the temperature rose at
once.  Big round white clouds were floating across
the sky like sails.  Misty, fluffy stars twinkled like
wind-blown flames and a waning copper-yellow
moon lay on its back over the black ridge of the
Lybian mountains.
</p>

<p>
Heaven, earth, water, plants, animals&mdash;all were
still asleep; men alone were awake.  The town down
below was stirring like an ant-heap.  Lights were
appearing in the windows, lamps were smoking on
the roofs, torches glowed in the streets filled with
dark crowds that streamed along like rivers.  There
was a hum of voices, rustle of feet, stamping of
hoofs, clatter of wheels, neighing of horses, cries of
soldiers and the ceaseless call of the trumpets&mdash;the
hymn to Aton:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Glorious is Thy rising in the East,<br>
  Lord and giver of life, Aton!<br>
  Thou sendest Thy rays and darkness flees,<br>
  All the earth is filled with joy.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"There goes the royal procession!  Let us run
downstairs, girls, we can see better from there!"
cried one of those who were looking from the roof
of Aton's temple, and they all flew downstairs like a
flock of turtle-doves, on to the flat top of the gates
nearest the street where the procession was passing.
</p>

<p>
"The king!  The king!  Down!  Down!  Down!"
cried the runners, scattering the crowd with their
staves as they marched along in step, their bare
backs bent double.
</p>

<p>
The king's bodyguard, the Hittite Amazons, came
next.  Yellow skinned and flat chested, with narrow
eyes and high cheek bones, one warrior lock on their
shaven heads, they carried bronze double-edged axes,
the sacred weapon of the Virgin-Mother.
</p>

<p>
Then came courtiers, judges, councillors, warlords,
treasurers, clerks, priests, soothsayers, scribes,
chiefs of the bakers, chiefs of the butlers, chiefs of
the king's stables, lords of the bedchamber, masters
of the robes, hairdressers, launderers, perfumers and
so on: all were dressed in white robes with pointed,
stiffly starched aprons; all wore the special skullcaps
that made their shaven heads look like the egg-shaped
'royal marrows.'
</p>

<p>
Then came the censer-bearers, lavishly burning
incense, its white clouds turning rosy in the torchlight;
these were followed by the fan-bearers waving
multi-coloured fans of ostrich feathers and real
flowers, fixed on long poles.
</p>

<p>
Finally there came twenty-four black Ethiopian
youths, naked but for short aprons of parrot feathers
and wearing golden nose rings; they carried on their
shoulders a tall ivory throne covered with leaf gold
with lions for a pedestal.
</p>

<p>
Dio clearly saw the leopard skin on the narrow
boyish shoulders, the simple long white robe of such
transparent linen that one could see through it above
the elbows of the thin dark-skinned boyish arms, the
coloured hieroglyphics of Aton's name; she saw the
staff&mdash;symbol of godhead&mdash;in one hand and the
scourge in the other; the pear-shaped royal tiara,
made of pale cham, a mixture of gold and silver,
studded with small stars of lapis lazuli, and the
golden snake of the sun, Uta, coiled on the forehead.
</p>

<p>
She saw all this but she did not dare to look at
his face.  "I will look when I am dancing before
him," she thought, as she ran upstairs to the roof
of Aton's temple.
</p>

<p>
"Down!  Down!  The king comes! the god
comes!" the runners shouted, and people bowed to
the ground.
</p>

<p>
The procession entered the gates of Aton's temple.
</p>

<p>
The temple of the Sun, the House of Joy, consisted
of seven pillared courts, with tower-like pylon
gates, side-chapels and three hundred and sixty-five
altars.  Seven courts were the seven temples of
the seven peoples, for as it says in the hymn to
Aton:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Thou hast carried them all away captive,<br>
  Thou bindest them by Thy love.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
There was a time when by 'people'&mdash;<i>romet</i>&mdash;the
Egyptians meant themselves only; all other nations
were excluded; but now all were brothers, children
of one Heavenly Father, Aton.  The Temple of the
Sun was the temple for all mankind.
</p>

<p>
Seven courts, seven temples: the first was
dedicated to Tammuz of Babylon, the second to Attis
of the Hittites, the third to Adon of Canaan, the
fourth to Adun of Crete, the fifth to Mithra of
Mitanni, the sixth to Ashmun of Phoenicia, the
seventh to Zagreus-Bacchus of Thrace.  All these
god-men who had suffered, died and risen from the
dead, were but shadows of the one sun that was to
rise&mdash;the Son.
</p>

<p>
The seven open temples led into the eighth, the
secret one, which no one but the king and the high
priest dared enter.  There in perpetual twilight stood
sixteen giant Osirises made of alabaster, pale as
phantoms, tightly bound with winding sheets, wearing
gods' tiaras and holding a staff&mdash;symbol of
god-head&mdash;in one hand and a scourge in the other; the
faces of all were in the likeness of King Akhnaton.
</p>

<p>
Passing through the seven open temples the
procession approached the eighth, the secret one.  The
king went into it alone, and, while he was praying
there, all waited outside.  When he came out, they
mounted by an outside staircase on to the flat roof
of the upper temple, which was built on the roof of
the lower.
</p>

<p>
The great altar of the Sun stood here; it was
made of huge blocks of cream-coloured sandstone,
pale as a girl's body and shaped like a pyramid with
its top cut off; two gradual approaches, without
steps, led up to it.  On a high platform at the top of
the pyramid a sanctuary fire was perpetually burning,
and, above it on a column of alabaster, the sun
disc of Aton, made of pale cham&mdash;a mixture of gold
and silver&mdash;glistened with a dull brilliance.  It was
the highest point of the huge edifice and the first and
last ray of the sun was always reflected upon it.
</p>

<p>
The king, the queen, the princesses and the heir
apparent&mdash;only those in whose veins flowed the
blood of the Sun&mdash;went up to the top of the pyramid,
and then the king alone ascended the platform where
the fire was burning.
</p>

<p>
People thronged in the seven courts of the temple
down below, on the pylons, the staircases, the roofs
of both temples; it was like a living mountain of
people and the highest point of it was one man&mdash;the
king.
</p>

<p>
"I come to glorify Thy rays, living Aton, one
eternal God!" he said stretching out his arms to the
Sun.
</p>

<p>
"Praise be to Thee, living Aton, who hast made
the heavens and the mysteries thereof," answered the
high priest Merira, who stood at the base of the
pyramid.  "Thou art in heaven and Thy beloved son
Akhnaton is on earth!"
</p>

<p>
"I show the way of life to all of you, generations
that have been and are to come," the king continued.
"Give praise to the God Aton, the living God, and
ye shall live!  Gather together and come, all ye people
of salvation; turn to the Lord, all ye ends of the
earth, for Aton is God and there is none other God
but He."
</p>

<p>
"The God Aton is the only God and there is none
other God but He," answered the innumerable
crowds down below, and the call of thousands was
like the roar of the sea.
</p>

<p>
The moon had set, the stars were hardly visible.
The wind dropped, the clouds cleared away, the sky
was almost grey.  And suddenly a giant ray, shaped
like a pyramid with its base on the ground and its
top in the zenith, appeared in the morning twilight
and white opalescent lights, like sheet lightning,
flickered across it&mdash;the Light of the Zodiac, the
forerunner of the Sun.
</p>

<p>
The king, with his wife, daughters and the heir
apparent, descended from the pyramid altar and
went into a painted and gilded tent that stood at the
eastern side of it.
</p>

<p>
There was a sound of flutes and a ringing of citherns,
then came subdued singing and a slow procession
of priestesses, carrying a coffin on their shoulders,
mounted the flat roof of the temple by an outer
staircase.  A dead body wrapped up in a white
winding sheet lay in the coffin.  The priestesses
placed the coffin on the dark purple carpet before
the king's tent.
</p>

<p>
Two mourners came forward, one stood at the
head and the other at the feet of the corpse, weeping
and calling to each other like the two sister goddesses
Isis and Neftis at the tomb of Osiris, their brother.
Meanwhile the others, naked but for a narrow black
belt below the navel and a black 'bandage of shame'
between the legs, were dancing the wild, ancient,
magical dance of Osiris-Bata, the rising god, the
vegetating ear of corn: standing in a row on one leg
they raised the other leg all at once, lowered it and
then raised it again, higher and higher each time,
so that at last the toes went up higher than the
heads.
</p>

<p>
"Arise, arise, arise!  O Sun of all suns, O first
fruits of them that slept, arise!" they repeated, also
all at once, to the ringing of the citherns and the
squealing of flutes.  This meant: "grow up as high
as our legs are thrown up, o ear of corn, arise, thou
dead one!"
</p>

<p>
And the mourners wept:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Come to thy sister, come, my Beloved,<br>
  Thou whose heart now beats no more!<br>
  I am thy sister who loved thee on earth,<br>
  No one has loved thee more than I!"<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Suddenly a quiver passed over the corpse, as over
a chrysalis when a butterfly stirs within it&mdash;a tremor
that was like the tremulous lightnings in the sky, as
though the same miracle were happening in the
human body and in the heavens.
</p>

<p>
The grave clothes wrapped round the corpse were
slowly unwound; the hand was slowly raised to the
face as that of one waking from profound slumber;
the knees bent slowly; the elbows rested against the
bottom of the coffin and the body began to rise.
</p>

<p>
"Arise!  Arise!  Arise!" the dancers repeated as
an incantation, throwing up their legs higher than
their heads in the magical dance.
</p>

<p>
The light of the Zodiac was no longer visible in
the rosy light of the dawn.  A glowing ember blazed
up in the misty crevice of the Arabian mountains
and the first ray of the sun glistened on Aton's disc.
</p>

<p>
At the same moment the corpse rose, opened its
eyes and smiled&mdash;and in that smile there was eternal
life, the sun that has no setting.
</p>

<p>
"Dio, the dancer, the Pearl of the Kingdom of the
Seas," a whisper was heard in the crowd of the
courtiers.
</p>

<p>
The priestesses finished their magical dance and
fell, face downwards, on the ground.  The citherns
and flutes were silent except one which was still
weeping; it was like a lonely bird crying in the
twilight:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "On my bed in the night<br>
  I looked for him,<br>
  For him whom my soul loveth,<br>
  I sought him and did not find him."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Stepping out of the coffin, Dio moved towards
the sun.  She began the dance slowly and quietly, as
though in her sleep; there was still something of the
stiffness of death in her limbs.  But as the sun rose
higher the dance grew quicker and more impetuous.
Her head was thrown back, her arms were stretched
towards the sun; the white veils fell on the purple
carpet, revealing the innocent body, neither
masculine nor feminine&mdash;at once masculine and
feminine&mdash;a marvel of godlike beauty.  The sun was
kissing her and she was surrendering herself to it,
the mortal uniting with the god as a bride with
her lover.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Put me as a seal upon thine heart,<br>
  "As a ring upon thine hand<br>
  For strong as death is love,"<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
sobbed the flute.
</p>

<p>
The song stopped suddenly; the dancer fell flat
on her back as though dead.  One of the priestesses
ran up to her and covered her with the white grave
clothes.
</p>

<p>
The soft sound of footsteps and a voice that
seemed familiar, though she had never heard it,
reached Dio's ears.  She raised her head and saw the
king face to face.  He was saying something to her
but she could not make it out.  She looked into his
face eagerly as though recognising him after a long,
long parting: this was perhaps how lovers recognised
each other in the world beyond the grave.
</p>

<p>
She recalled her fear of him and was surprised
not to be feeling any.  A simple, quite a simple, face
like anybody else's; the face of the son of man, the
brother of man, gentle, very gentle like the face of
the god whose name is Quiet Heart.
</p>

<p>
"Are you very tired?" he was asking, probably
not for the first time.
</p>

<p>
"No, not very."
</p>

<p>
"How well you danced!  Our dancers can't do it.
Is this your Cretan dance?"
</p>

<p>
"Both ours and yours together."
</p>

<p>
He, too, was gazing at her as though trying to
recognise her.
</p>

<p>
"Where have I seen you?"
</p>

<p>
"Nowhere, sire."
</p>

<p>
"Strange, I keep fancying I have seen you before...."
</p>

<p>
She was sitting at his feet and he stood bending
over her.  Both were uncomfortable.  The white sheet
kept slipping off her naked body and she was trying
unsuccessfully to keep it on.  She suddenly felt
confused and blushed.
</p>

<p>
"Are you cold?  Go along and get dressed," he
said and blushed, too.  'Just like a little boy,' she
thought, and recalled the figure at the Charuk
palace&mdash;the boy who looked like a girl.
</p>

<p>
He took a ring off his finger, put it on hers, and,
bending down still lower, kissed her on the head.
Then he left her and returned to the royal tent.
</p>

<p>
"The fish has bitten!" an old dignitary, Ay, Tuta's
friend and patron, who stood next to him in the
crowd of courtiers, whispered in his ear.
</p>

<p>
"You think so?" Tuta asked joyfully.
</p>

<p>
"Set your mind at rest: it has bitten.  You couldn't
find another such pair: they have been made for
each other.  Man and woman&mdash;a hook and an
eye&mdash;are two in love, but here there are four."
</p>

<p>
"How do you mean?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, there are two in him, two in her; an eye&mdash;a
hook, a hook&mdash;an eye; once they catch there will
be no disentangling them."
</p>

<p>
"You are a wise man, Ay!" Tuta said in delight.
</p>

<p class="dropcap">
A choir of blind singers began the
hymn to Aton.
</p>

<p>
They had been tramps and beggars
walking along the high roads
from village to village.  One day
the king heard them at the gates
of Aton's temple and liked their singing so much
that he made them temple choristers&mdash;that God
might receive praise not only from the happy, the
wise and the seeing, but also from the blind, wretched
and ignorant.
</p>

<p>
There were seven of them.  They sat on their
heels in a row before the king's tent, dressed only
in short white aprons, their limbs thin as sticks,
their bodies, with distended stomachs and the ribs
showing through the skin, blackened by the sun,
their heads shaven, their faces wrinkled; the folds
of the skin near the mouth resembled those of an
old sick dog; they were snub-nosed and, like dogs,
seemed to be always sniffing; there were narrow,
inflamed slits where their eyes should have been.
</p>

<p>
The leader of the choir sat in front playing a
high seven-stringed harp, while the others, clapping
their hands in time, sang in nasal voices but with
remarkable intensity of feeling.  They looked straight
at the sun with their blind eyes but, not seeing the
god of light, Ra, they glorified the god of warmth,
Shu:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Shu our Father, Shu our Mother!<br>
  Weeping we have lost our sight.<br>
  We praise the sun out of the night.<br>
  Have mercy on us, poor blind men!"<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
And when they finished the melancholy song they
began a joyous one:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Glorious is thy rising in the East,<br>
  Lord and giver of life, Aton<br>
  Thou sendest thy rays and darkness flees,<br>
  And the earth is filled with joy.<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
The roof of the temple was flooded with sunshine,
but the seven courts below were still in the shadow
and only the high tops of the pylons were gilded by
the sun; the bright-coloured pennants on the masts
above them fluttered gaily in the morning breeze,
white doves flapped their wings joyfully and winter
swallows, in their whistling flight, cleft the air
singing to the sun, shouting and shrilly calling with
joy: 'Ra!'
</p>

<p>
The king mounted the pyramidal altar once more
and threw a handful of incense into the fire.  The
flame blazed up, turning pale in the sun, clouds of
rosy-white smoke rose in the air and immediately
similar clouds rose from the three hundred and sixty-five
altars in the seven courts below: anyone seeing
it from a distance would have thought the city was
on fire.
</p>

<p>
Slowly raising his arms to the sky, as though
offering an invisible sacrifice, the king proclaimed:
</p>

<p>
"All there is between the eastern hills and the
western hills&mdash;fields, waters, villages, plants,
animals, men&mdash;all is brought as sacrifice to thee, Aton,
the living Sun, so that thy kingdom may be on earth
as it is in heaven, O Father!"
</p>

<p>
The black harvest of human heads bent down like
the harvest corn in the wind.  Trumpets, flutes,
citherns, harps, lyres, timbrels, cymbals, kinnors
combined with the thousands of voices into one
deafening chorus.
</p>

<p>
</p>

<p>
"Sing unto the Lord a new song, sing unto the Lord,
the earth and all that therein is!  Give unto the Lord
glory and honour, oh ye tribes of the earth!  Let the
heavens rejoice and the earth sing in triumph!  Rejoice,
Joy of the Sun, the only begotten Son of the Sun,
Akhnaton Uaenra!"
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="quote">
Gazing into the king's face, Dio thought with as
much joy as though she were already seeing the Son
Who was to come: "no son of man has been nearer
to Him than he!"
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Only high officials were admitted into the enclosure
round the king's tent.  But beyond the enclosure
a special place was set apart for the new converts&mdash;men
of all classes and nationalities&mdash;Babylonians,
Hittites, Canaanites, Aegians, Lybians, Mitannians,
Thracians, Ethiopians and even Jews.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly Dio saw in that crowd Issachar, the son
of Hamuel.  He was watching the king intently, his
mouth twisted in a malignant smile.  Dio could not
take her eyes off Issachar's face: she was trying to
remember something.
</p>

<p>
The singing stopped and in the sudden stillness the
king's voice was heard:
</p>

<p>
"Lord, before the world was made, thou hast
revealed thy will to thy Son who lives forever.  Thou,
Father, art in my heart and no one knows thee but
me, thy Son."
</p>

<p>
"Cursed be the deceiver who said 'I am the Son,'"&mdash;Dio
suddenly recalled Issachar's words in the
Gem-ton Chapel and, looking at the king again, she
thought with terror: "Who is he?  Who is he?  Who
is he?"

</div>

<p class="dropcap">
The children of Israel which came
into Egypt were seventy souls; but
now the Lord has made us as many
as the stars in heaven.  And the
king of Egypt said unto his people
'behold the people of the children
of Israel are more and mightier than we.  Come on,
let us deal wisely with them, lest they multiply and
it come to pass that when there falleth out any war
they join also unto our enemies.'  And so they did
set over us taskmasters to afflict us with their
burdens and they made our lives bitter with hard
bondage in mortar and in brick.  And we sighed and
groaned by reason of the bondage and our cry had
come unto the Lord.  And the Lord stretched out his
hand and brought us out of Egypt, from the house
of bondage.  And when the King of Egypt and his
army overtook us by the Red Sea, Moses stretched
out his hand over the sea and the waters were
divided and the children of Israel went into the
midst of the sea upon the dry ground and the waters,
were a wall unto them on their right hand and on
their left.  And the waters came again upon the
Egyptians and covered them; they sank to the
bottom as a stone."
</p>

<p>
This was the story as the Israelites told it, but the
Egyptians laughed at them:
</p>

<p>
"Nothing of the kind has happened: no king of
Egypt ever perished in the sea, and the leader of
the Jews whom they call in Egyptian <i>Mosu&mdash;Child,
Son</i>&mdash;is not a 'Son of God' at all, as they imagine,
but the son of a slave, a wicked sorcerer, murderer
and thief, who ran away into the desert to the
Midian nomads and then secretly returned to Egypt
and became the leader of a robber band of Khabiri,
the Plunderers, who are the same as the Jews.  The
Khabiri are continually rising in the border lands of
Egypt.  In the days of King Tutmose the Fourth
there was such a rising; a band of Khabiri went to
the desert of Sinai and perished there of hunger
and thirst together with <i>Mosu</i> or Moses, their
leader."
</p>

<p>
This was how the sons of Ham mocked the sons
of Israel.  And, indeed, not only the Egyptians but
many of the Israelites themselves&mdash;for Moses led
only a part of them out of Egypt&mdash;refused to believe
the miracles of Exodus or to worship the new god,
Jahve.
</p>

<p>
"What sort of god is it?" they asked.  "We do
not know him.  Jahve in the Midian language means
'Destroyer.'  He is the god of the nomads of Sinai
and not of the Israelites, the demon of the desert,
a consuming fire.  His son, Moses, covered his face
when he appeared before the people lest they should
discover whom he was like.  No, the gods of our
fathers, the gentle Elohim, were different: Eliun,
the Father, El-Shaddai the Son, and El Ruach, the
Mother.  This new god is anger, tempest, consuming
fire and those three are mercy, loving kindness,
dewy freshness."
</p>

<p>
And they also said:
</p>

<p>
"There has been no Exodus but there will be;
there has been no Son yet but the Son is to come
according to the words of our father Jacob: 'the
sceptre shall not depart from Judah nor a lawgiver
from between his feet until the Messiah come.'"
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Hamuel, son of Avinoam of the house of Judah,
a priest of El-Shaddai, worshipped the old gods,
the Elohim, hated the new god Jahve and awaited
the coming of the Messiah.
</p>

<p>
He was a wise man; he doctored the sick; told
fortunes by throwing dice&mdash;<i>teraphim</i>&mdash;which revealed
the divine preordination of human destinies;
he received good pay for this and also made money
by a traffic, of which the Customs officers knew
nothing, in silphium, a medicinal herb from Lybia,
and the balm of Gilead for anointing the dead.  He
lived in the town of Bubastis at the mouth of the
Nile, protected by gods and respected by men.
</p>

<p>
He had two sons: the elder Eliav by Thamar, an
Israelite, and the younger Issachar by Asta, an
Egyptian.
</p>

<p>
It had happened that Hamuel went on business
to the town of Mendes; there, in the temple of the
god Goat, he saw a little girl priestess, Asta, and
fell in love with her so much that he did not hesitate
to give a hundred gold rings, <i>utens</i>, the price of
thirty pairs of oxen, to pay for her flight from the
temple: the priestesses betrothed to the god could not
under the penalty of death marry anyone and especially
not an 'unclean' Jew.  Asta loved her mortal
husband ardently, but could not forgive herself for
being unfaithful to the immortal one and suffered
such remorse that her mind became slightly deranged.
When she gave birth to a son she imagined that she
had conceived him by the god: the priestesses
believed that the god Goat, the fiery-red Bindidi&mdash;Sun-Ra
in the flesh and the source of virility in men
and beasts&mdash;had carnal union with them.  Asta whispered
strange stories to the little Iserker, as she called
Issachar in Egyptian, and sang strange songs to
him about the golden-fleeced, golden-horned Goat
that grazed in the azure meadows of the sky and
came down sometimes to love the beautiful daughters
of the earth.
</p>

<p>
Hamuel's first wife, the Israelite, Thamar, bitterly
hated the Egyptian and her 'devil's brood, the son
of the stinking Goat.'  And there really was
something goat-like in Issachar's face&mdash;in his thick
hooked nose, thick lips, slanting yellow eyes and,
when he grew up, in the long reddish curls that hung
alongside his cheeks, the long parted reddish beard
and the raucous, high-pitched, bleating voice.
</p>

<p>
The schoolboys teased little Iserker and called
him "the red goat!"  Egyptians considered red-haired
people unclean because Set, the devil, was red
like the sand of the desert, his kingdom: seeing a
red-haired man in the street passers-by spat to avert
bad fortune and mothers hid their children from his
evil eye.  'It is a bad thing to be red-haired'&mdash;the
little boy had known this ever since he could
remember himself, but he could not decide, even when
he had grown up, whether it was a good or a bad
thing to be the son of the god Goat.  It might be
good for Iserker, the Egyptian, but bad for Issachar,
the Israelite; but he never knew whether he was
Iserker or Issachar and this was perpetual torture to
him.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
When, in the early years of the reign of Amenhotep
the Fourth, or Akhnaton, as he was to call
himself later&mdash;news came of the victories of Joshua
in the Promised Land, a rebellion broke out among
the Israelites left in Egypt.  The rebellion started in
the town of Bubastis.  Hamuel's son Eliav, who was
about twenty-five years old, had been seen at the
head of the rebels' army.  The rebellion was crushed;
Eliav ran away and instead of him Issachar, his
brother, who was completely innocent, was seized
and thrown into prison as a hostage.  Asta went
from one judge to another giving bribes right and
left; they took the bribes but kept the hostage.  Then
someone informed against Eliav, who had been
hiding in the marshy jungles of the Delta; he was
seized and Issachar released.
</p>

<p>
Soon after this Asta died suddenly after drinking
some cold beer on a hot day; a few days later two
maid-servants in Hamuel's house had a quarrel and
one of them told that the other had poisoned their
mistress.  When both were cross-examined, the
accused confessed that she poisoned Asta at the
instigation of Thamar.  The latter did not deny it and
said to her husband straight out:
</p>

<p>
"I have killed Asta because she informed against
Eliav.  Kill me, too: blood for blood, life for life."
</p>

<p>
She spoke in this way because she worshipped the
fierce Jahve, the Avenger.  But Hamuel, a priest of
the gentle El-Shaddai, had mercy on her and merely
ordered her to leave his house for ever.  That same
night Thamar hanged herself and Hamuel did not
survive her long&mdash;he died of grief.  On his deathbed
he admonished Issachar, his son, to await the
Messiah.
</p>

<p>
Left alone in the world, Issachar went to
Nut-Amon&mdash;Thebes&mdash;to his maternal grandfather, the
priest Ptahotep, who was the keeper of scrolls in the
sanctuary of Amon; there he assumed the rank of
a junior priest&mdash;<i>uab</i>&mdash;and became a pupil of
Ptamose, the high priest of Amon.
</p>

<p>
When the apostate king began to persecute the old
faith, many of Ptamose's pupils proved false to
their teacher either through fear or love of gain;
but Issachar remained true to him.
</p>

<p>
Issachar's perpetual torment was that he could
not decide whether he was a Jew or an Egyptian;
through revealing to him the mysteries of the divine
wisdom, Ptamose solved the question for him: the
deeper Issachar studied them, the clearer he saw
that the god-man, Osiris, who had been slain, and
He of Whom the prophets of Israel had said: "He
has poured out His soul unto death and made intercession
for the transgressors" were one and the same
Messiah.

<p class="dropcap">
After the mutiny at Thebes, Issachar
went to Akhetaton, the City
of the Sun, to see his brother Eliav
and to carry out a behest of Ptamose
so secret and terrible that he
was afraid even to think of it,
to say nothing of discussing it with anyone.
</p>

<p>
At the bottom of a deep cauldron-shaped hollow
among the rocks of the Arabian hills, east of the
City and within half an hour's walk from it, lay the
penal settlement of the Israelites sentenced to work
in the neighbouring quarries of Hat-Nub.  The
Egyptians called it the Dirty Jews' Village and the
Israelite's name for it was Sheol&mdash;Hell.
</p>

<p>
Some ten days after Aton's nativity, Issachar
walked to Sheol to see his brother Eliav.
</p>

<p>
An old man of seventy, looking like Abraham,
with a fine, deeply lined, dark-skinned face and a
long white beard, was walking beside him; he was
Issachar's uncle, Ahiram, son of Halev, a rich
merchant from the town of Tanis.  They were climbing
by a narrow goat's path one of the hills west of
Sheol.
</p>

<p>
The sun was setting in the red mist, as in a pool
of blood, and the bare rocks of yellow sandstone,
covered in places with waves of loose sand, glowed
with a red hot glow.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose you took part in the Nut-Amon rising,
my boy, didn't you?" Ahiram asked.
</p>

<p>
"I?  Oh, no.  I am a peaceful man.  And besides
the holy father does not allow us to fight," Issachar
answered.  By 'holy father' he meant Ptamose.
</p>

<p>
The old man shook his head doubtfully.
</p>

<p>
"Come, come, you are telling fibs, I see it from
your eyes!  All of you, priests of Amon, are rebels.
But remember, my son, nothing is to be gained by
rebellion."
</p>

<p>
"What is one to do then?" Issachar asked.
</p>

<p>
The old man stroked his long white beard with
a sly smile.
</p>

<p>
"Why, this; listen.  When our forefather, Abraham,
went to Egypt from Canaan because of the
famine, he said to Sarah, his wife: 'you are a fair
woman to look upon; say to the Egyptians you are
my sister that it may be well with me for your
sake.'  She did as he asked and was taken into Pharaoh's
house, and it was well with Abraham for her sake
and he had sheep and oxen and he-asses, and
men-servants and maidservants and she-asses, and camels.
And the Lord plagued Pharaoh and his house with
great plagues because of Sarah, Abraham's wife.
This is how it was, my son!  Blessed be the children
of Israel, the people preserved by the Lord!  They
shall overthrow their enemies by cunning and not
by rebellion or violence," the old man said in
conclusion, and his eyes sparkled with Abraham's
slyness.
</p>

<p>
A young eagle flew up from the rock, silvery-grey
in the glow of sunset that lighted it from below;
the royal bird circled round and round, looking out
for prey in the desert&mdash;a baby antelope or a bustard.
</p>

<p>
"I bare you on eagles' wings and brought you
unto myself," Issachar recalled the words of God to
Israel.  "This is how he bears me now," he thought.
He remembered, too, what Ptamose said when he
sent him to the City of the Sun: "Be firm and have
courage, my son, for the Lord is with you: He will
do it for you."  And he gave him a small bronze
sacrificial knife, with the head of the god Amon-Ra
for a handle; Ptamose did not say what the knife
was for and Issachar did not ask&mdash;he knew.
</p>

<p>
Recalling this he thrust his hand under his cloak,
and feeling the knife hidden in his broad leather belt,
clasped its handle firmly and tenderly as a lover
clasps the hand of his mistress.  "Well, am I afraid?"
he thought.  "No, not afraid at all: He will do it
for me.  He bears me and will bring me unto
Himself!"  And turning to Ahiram he said:
</p>

<p>
"Dear uncle, will you get me a pass?"
</p>

<p>
He had wanted to say this for several days, but
did not dare to, and he had not known a minute
before that he would say it.
</p>

<p>
"What pass?"
</p>

<p>
"Into the palace to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
"Have you gone crazy, my boy?  Where am I to
get a permit for you with the night coming on?"
</p>

<p>
"Uncle dear, you can do anything, you know
everybody, you have influence.  Do get it for me,
please do!"  Issachar entreated him as though it were
a matter of life and death.
</p>

<p>
"What do you want it for?" Ahiram asked, looking
at him attentively.
</p>

<p>
"To see the king!"
</p>

<p>
"But you have seen him already."
</p>

<p>
"Only from a distance.  To-morrow is the day of
petitions, everybody will be allowed to go right up to
the throne.  I should see him quite near, face to face.
I like him very much.  Joy of the Sun, Joy of the
Sun, to see him is a joy."  Issachar said ecstatically.
</p>

<p>
"No, you shall not have a pass," Ahiram said
decidedly, shaking his head.  "God only knows what is
in your mind, you might get me into trouble...."
</p>

<p>
Issachar took a purse from his bosom and producing
from it a two-inch sacred scarabee, Kheper,
made of beautiful Sinai lapis-lazuli, gave it Ahiram.
</p>

<p>
The old man seized it greedily, weighed it on his
palm and scrutinized it for a few minutes.
</p>

<p>
"A fine stone," he said at last, divided between the
delight of a connoisseur and the wish to beat down
the price.  "There is a little flaw in it, it looks dull
and greenish in one place, but it is a lovely thing all
the same.  It's from Amon's treasury, isn't it?  Did
you steal it?"
</p>

<p>
"What next, uncle!  I am not a thief.  Holy father
gave it to me."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, what for?  Though indeed there are all sorts
of fools in the world&mdash;some give presents for
nothing.  How much do you want for it?"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing, only get me the pass."
</p>

<p>
The old man's eyes glittered, he examined the
stone again, and even tried it with his tongue and
teeth; then he stroked his beard with a quick, as it
were, thievish movement, and lifting an eyebrow
and screwing up one eye, said giving back the stone:
</p>

<p>
"Look here, my son, don't sleep in the town
to-night: there will be a search.  The chief of the
guards, Mahu, has got wind of something and is
looking for the Nut-Amon rebels.  Spend the night
in the Goats' cave above Sheol; Naaman will take
you there.  If I procure the pass I will come there
before midnight, and if I don't it will mean things
have gone wrong&mdash;then save yourself and run
away."
</p>

<p>
Issachar handed him the stone once more, but he
did not take it.
</p>

<p>
"No, I will not take it in advance.  Payment is
due when the goods are delivered.  I am an honest
merchant."
</p>

<p>
He was speaking the truth&mdash;he was honest; an
honest man and a rogue at the same time, after the
manner of Abraham.
</p>

<p>
"I am sorry for you, my red-haired boy!" he
said quietly, with an old man's benignity.  "Your
brother Eliav has perished for nothing; mind the
same thing does not happen to you....  Remember,
my son: man is born to suffering as a spark flies
upward, and yet the sight of the sun is sweet to the
living; a living dog is better than a dead lion."
</p>

<p>
"He has bought my soul for a stone and here
he pities me," Issachar marvelled.  He looked once
more at the eagle still circling in the sky, thought
of what was to happen next day and his heart
throbbed with joy: "He hears me and will bring me
unto himself!"
</p>

<p>
They climbed to the top of the hill and saw in the
hollow below a regular quadrangle of uniform
houses, intersected by a network of streets and
surrounded by high walls.
</p>

<p>
The dead desert was all round; not a tree, not a
bush, nothing but stones and sand; in the winter it
was a cold grave, in the summer a scorching oven, a
true Hell&mdash;Sheol.
</p>

<p>
A stench as though of decaying carrion came from
below.  Ahiram sniffed and frowned.
</p>

<p>
"Oho-hoho!  It's the human smell, the smell of
two-legged cattle.  There is no well or spring near,
and one can't be forever going to the river to fetch
water; they stifle in their own stench, poor things!"
</p>

<p>
They descended rapidly by the goats' path to the
bottom of the valley and approached the entrance to
Sheol.  Ahiram knocked.  A window in the wall was
opened, the gatekeeper peeped out and, recognizing
the old man, unlocked the gate.  He did not mean to
admit Issachar, but Ahiram whispered something in
his ear, thrust something into his hand and he let
them both in.
</p>

<p>
Long, narrow, perfectly straight streets led from
the square at the entrance into the centre of the
settlement.  One side of each street was a bare wall
and the other a uniform row of mud huts that
resembled stable stalls; the streets were like prison
corridors, the huts like prison cells.  There were no
storehouses or granaries; all the inhabitants of Sheol
received government rations.
</p>

<p>
Dirty pools with clouds of flies buzzing over them
and heaps of filth and dung spread such an evil smell
that the whole village seemed to be one enormous
heap of refuse.
</p>

<p>
"I put the plague of leprosy in a house of the land
of your possession," the Lord said to Israel.  "If the
plague be in the walls of the house with hollow
strokes, greenish and reddish, the stones in which
the plague is shall be taken away and cast into an
unclean place; and if the plague come again and be
spread in the house, it is a fretting leprosy; the
house shall be broken down."
</p>

<p>
All the houses in Sheol had such leprosy.  Lifeless
stones were cankered by filth, and living bodies
of men even more so; the unfortunate creatures
which came down into Hell while still on earth were
covered with rashes, ulcers, spots, festers, and the
terrible white scabs of leprosy.
</p>

<p>
The king in his mercy allowed the prisoners'
families to live with them, but this only made
matters worse: people were suffering from overcrowding
more than ever.  "The dirty Jews' wives are
fruitful," the gaolers said jeeringly.  "In multiplying
I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven."  The
Lord blessed Israel, but this blessing turned
into a curse; numberless children were born and
died, teeming in the filthy place like maggots in
carrion.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Thou hast carried them all away captive.<br>
  Thou bindest them by Thy love."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Issachar recalled the king's hymn to the god Aton.
"Fine sort of love," he thought, "casting the living
into hell!"
</p>

<p>
Ahiram brought his nephew to Eliav's hut and
saying good-bye to him went back to the city to get
the pass.
</p>

<p>
Issachar walked into the half-dark entry.  Two
mangy sheep dozed in their stall; a sick old mule
and a scraggy ass stood dejectedly by an empty
water trough: beasts of burden carried stones in the
quarry and lived together with the prisoners.
</p>

<p>
Beside them a decrepit old man, naked but for a
ragged loin cloth, sat on a heap of dung and ashes
scraping with a potsherd the white scabs of leprosy
on his body, with a dull, monotonous wail, like the
howling of wind at night.  This was Shammai
the Righteous, the grandfather of Eliav's wife
Naomi.
</p>

<p>
He had once been rich, happy and respected by all;
he had salt mines by the Bitter Lakes and a lot of
cattle in the Goshen pastures, and he used to send
caravans with wool and salt into Midia.  He was a
godfearing man and led so blameless a life that he
was surnamed 'Righteous.'  He had hoped to live to
a happy old age and to die filled with days.  But it
pleased God to test him and he was suddenly deprived
of everything.  Two of his sons were lost with their
caravan in the desert, probably killed by robbers; the
other two perished in the rebellion.  His son-in-law,
who was steward over all his property, falsely
accused Shammai of having taken part in the rebellion.
The old man was seized and tried; the judges
acquitted him, but they had a compact with his son-in-law
and robbed him of all he had.  Now that he was
a beggar all his friends forsook him; his wife died.
He thought of Naomi, his favourite granddaughter,
and came to live with her in Sheol where he fell ill
with leprosy.
</p>

<p>
Sitting day and night among the ashes, he scraped
his scabs with a potsherd and comforted his heart
with wailing.  All the family had grown so used to
his endless wail that they noticed it no more than one
notices the creaking of a door, the sound of the wind
or the chirping of a grasshopper.
</p>

<p>
Issachar stopped in the entry and listened.
</p>

<p>
"Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the
night in which it was said there is a man child
conceived.  Why died I not from the womb?  For now
should I have lain still and been quiet, I should have
slept, then had I been at rest.  My soul is weary of
my life; I will say unto God, do not condemn me;
show me wherefore thou contendest with me.  Is
it good unto thee that thou shouldst destroy the
innocent?"
</p>

<p>
And it seemed to Issachar that Shammai's wail
was the lament of the whole people of Israel and,
perhaps, of all mankind from the beginning to the
end of time.
</p>

<p>
Walking past Shammai, he entered a dark and
narrow room dimly lighted by two small lamps filled
with mutton fat, one by the wall, on a wooden shelf
with little clay idols of the gods Elohim, and another
on the low brick platform with a block of stone on
it that served as a table.
</p>

<p>
Eliav was having supper at that table with his two
guests&mdash;Aviezer, a priest, and Naaman, a prophet.
</p>

<p>
Aviezer was a stout, important-looking man with
red cheeks and a black beard.  His luxurious dress
of Phoenician patterned material was not very clean;
a number of rings with imitation stones glittered on
his fingers.  He came to Sheol bringing alms for
the prisoners from the rich Goshen merchants.
</p>

<p>
Naaman, a plumber and a prophet&mdash;<i>nabi</i>&mdash;was a
little bald old man, gentle, shy and timid, with the
kind and simple face of a poor Israelite labourer.
He came from Thebes with Issachar.
</p>

<p>
There were other visitors present, but they sat at
a distance and took no part in the supper or the
conversation.
</p>

<p>
When Issachar saw his brother, a tall, round-shouldered,
bony man, with a face so deeply lined
that it seemed crumpled, everything else suddenly
vanished from his eyes and he only saw this
face&mdash;familiar, strange, pitiful, dear, and terrible.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, so you have arrived at last; I began to
think you weren't coming," Eliav said, getting up.
</p>

<p>
Issachar went up to him and was going to embrace
him when Eliav seized his hands with a quick movement
and holding him back looked into his eyes with
a laugh:
</p>

<p>
"Well, I should think we might embrace each
Other, or is it beneath your dignity?" he said, as
though it had been Issachar who held himself back.
</p>

<p>
Issachar threw his arms round Eliav's neck.
</p>

<p>
"Well, sit down," said Eliav, disengaging himself
and pointing to the place of honour by his side&mdash;a
low, half-circular stone chair.  "You see, we are
feasting here, enjoying your gifts without you.
Thank you for remembering us and sending alms to
us poor beggars.  I dare not offer you anything: you
Egyptians think our Jewish food unclean!"
</p>

<p>
"Why do you say such things, brother?" Issachar
began, but broke off, looking down and flushing
crimson.  He took a piece off the dish.
</p>

<p>
"Why, he is eating!  He really is, he doesn't
despise our food!" Eliav cried, with the same unkind
smile.
</p>

<p>
Aviezer also smiled into his beard, and Naaman
anxiously looked round at them all with his kind
eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps you will have a drink, too?" Eliav asked.
</p>

<p>
Issachar moved up his cup and Eliav filled it from
a jug with pomegranate wine, blood-red and thick as
oil&mdash;also his brother's present.  He poured some out
for himself, also.
</p>

<p>
"Your health, Iserker!"
</p>

<p>
He swallowed it at one gulp.
</p>

<p>
"Splendid wine this!  I have never drunk anything
like it."
</p>

<p>
He poured out some more.  His wife, Naomi, a
young, worn-looking woman with child, came up
to him and whispered in his ear:
</p>

<p>
"You must not take any more, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Why not?  I haven't seen my brother all these
years and I mayn't have a drink on the occasion?"
</p>

<p>
He rudely pushed her away, giving her such a
blow on the stomach with his elbow that she nearly
fell.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, my dears, please don't let him drink, there
will be trouble!" she begged the guests, retreating
submissively like a beaten dog.
</p>

<p>
"A second cup to the success of your errand!"
Eliav said.  "You must have come to us on business
I expect, and not for the pleasure of seeing your
brother.  Well, speak up, Iserker!  What have you
come for?"
</p>

<p>
"Issachar, not Iserker," his brother corrected him,
paling slightly and frowning.
</p>

<p>
"Issachar in Hebrew and Iserker in Egyptian,"
Eliav answered.  "Do you know yourself what your
name is, I wonder?  There now, don't be cross, don't
look at me like Abel.  I know you want to be an
Abel, but I am not a Cain...  Rabbi, what did Cain
kill Abel for?" he asked Aviezer.
</p>

<p>
"Because God accepted Abel's gift and rejected
Cain's."
</p>

<p>
"And why did God reject it?"
</p>

<p>
"No one knows this."
</p>

<p>
"That's always the way: no one knows the chief
thing.  But that was just the beginning of it all.  The
beginning was bad and I expect the end will be bad,
too....  Well then, tell me what news have you
brought us, Abel?"
</p>

<p>
"Good news, brother: the Lord has heard at last
the cry of Israel.  You will soon leave Sheol,
captives....  Nabi Naaman, you are God's prophet,
you know it all better than I do.  Speak!"
</p>

<p>
Naaman shook his head, with a shy smile.
</p>

<p>
"Prophet, indeed!  I am a simple man: all my
wisdom is in mending cauldrons and saucepans..."
</p>

<p>
"Never mind, speak; God will teach you!"
</p>

<p>
The old man looked down and was silent for a
time; then he began timidly and in a low voice,
obviously repeating somebody else's words:
</p>

<p>
"Thus speaks the Lord of Sabaoth, the God of
Israel: strengthen your arms which have grown
weak, steady your knees that tremble.  Behold your
God!  He shall come and save you; He shall stretch
out his arm, He shall judge and lead his people out
of Egypt, as out of the house of bondage.  The
second Exodus will be greater than the first, and
the new Leader of Israel greater than Moses!"
</p>

<p>
He raised his eyes and his voice rang out with
sudden force:
</p>

<p>
"How long, O Lord, shall the ungodly triumph?
They trample upon thy people, they oppress thine
inheritance, God of vengeance, Lord God of vengeance,
show thyself, punish the proud!  The Lord is
to sit in judgment upon the peoples; He shall be
judge of all flesh!"
</p>

<p>
"He is rather slow about it," Eliav said, with a
jeering smile and, as though in answer to him,
Shammai's wail was heard:
</p>

<p>
"Behold I cry out of wrong but I am not heard;
I cry aloud and there is no judgment!  Why does
God mock the torture of the innocent?  Why do
the wicked live and spend their days in wealth?
Why is the earth given over to evildoers and God
gives them countenance?  If it is not His doing,
whose doing is it?"
</p>

<p>
"Do you hear?" Eliav asked, looking straight into
Issachar's eyes.  "Shammai is right: there is no
judgment of God in the doings of men.  All your
prophecies are empty babble.  The earth is a paradise for
evildoers and a hell for the innocent, a Sheol.  You
are wretched comforters, useless physicians, all of
you, damnation upon you and your God!"
</p>

<p>
Aviezar looked at Eliav and said, "Do not blaspheme,
my son.  Woe to him who disputes with his
Maker."
</p>

<p>
"And what do you say, brother?" Eliav asked,
still looking straight into Issachar's eyes.  "Is
Shammai right?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, he is."
</p>

<p>
"Who is to answer him, then?"
</p>

<p>
"The Redeemer."
</p>

<p>
"And who is the Redeemer?"
</p>

<p>
"You know yourself."
</p>

<p>
"No, I don't.  So many prophets come to us&mdash;not
you alone.  Some say that King Akhnaton is the
Redeemer.  Perhaps you have come to us from him?"
</p>

<p>
"Why do you laugh, brother, why do you jeer at
what is holy?"
</p>

<p>
"But do you think you know what is holy?  Is it
true, they say you have been converted to the king's
faith?"
</p>

<p>
"No, it is not."
</p>

<p>
"How is it, then, you were seen the other day
at the festival of the Sun, among the converts?
Whom are you deceiving, them or us?  Why are
you silent?  Speak!"
</p>

<p>
"What am I to say, brother?  You won't believe
me in any case.  Wait till to-morrow&mdash;to-morrow
you shall know all."
</p>

<p>
"To-morrow?  No, tell me at once, at once, what
do you mean by saying 'you will soon leave Sheol,
captives'?  We shall not leave it without a rebellion.
Have you come to stir us up, then?"
</p>

<p>
"You shall know everything to-morrow," Issachar
repeated, getting up.
</p>

<p>
Eliav got up, too, and seized him by the hand.
</p>

<p>
"Stop, you shan't go like this!  If you won't tell
us, you will tell the king's overseer!"
</p>

<p>
"Will you inform against me?"
</p>

<p>
"And why not?  An eye for an eye, a tooth for
a tooth.  I have suffered for ten years on your
account, and now it is your turn.  Come along!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, my dears, hold him, hold him, there will
be trouble!" Naomi cried again.
</p>

<p>
All rushed at Eliav, but before they had time to
restrain him, he dashed to the corner, seized the
copper pickaxe, with which he broke stones in the
quarry, ran towards Issachar, and raised it over his
head, shouting:
</p>

<p>
"Get out of my sight, you son of the stinking
Goat, or I'll kill you!"
</p>

<p>
Issachar ran out of the house, covering his face
with his hands.
</p>

<p>
He ran along the dark streets, stumbling, falling,
getting up, and running on again in terror.
</p>

<p>
He only came to himself outside the Sheol gates.
Naaman had been running beside him and saying to
him something he could not make out; at last he
grasped that Naaman said:
</p>

<p>
"Let us run to the Goats' Cave and spend the
night there."
</p>

<p>
By a steep narrow footpath cut in the rock, they
ascended from the Sheol valley to the open ground
at the top of the hill.  A small red light flickered in
the distance.  They walked towards it.  Fierce sheep
dogs, with heads like spiders, rushed at them barking.
</p>

<p>
An old shepherd came out to meet them; he drove
away the dogs and welcomed his guests with a low
bow, calling Naaman by name.  He had evidently
been expecting them and led them straight to the
cave at the top of the cliff overhanging Sheol.
</p>

<p>
Two young shepherds, who had been sitting by
the bonfire in the cave among a sleeping flock of
goats and sheep, got up and also made a low bow.
They put more wood on the fire, spread some sheep-skins
on the ground, and wishing their guests good-night,
went out together with the old shepherd.
</p>

<p>
Issachar and Naaman sat down by the fire.
</p>

<p>
"Man is born to suffering as a spark flies upward,"
Issachar recalled Ahiram's words as he gazed
at the sparks in the smoking fire and he thought
"To-morrow Eliav will learn everything and will forgive
and love me."
</p>

<p>
He lay down and as soon as he closed his eyes
began to descend by the dark subterranean passages
into the Nut-Amon sanctuary of the god Ram; he
went on and on, but he could not reach it&mdash;he had
lost his way.  A small red light flickered in the
distance.  He walked towards it.  The light grew bigger
and bigger and became at last a red sun upon the
black sky.  Someone was standing under it, dressed
in white, with a face as gentle as that of the god
whose name is Quiet Heart.  A quiet voice said,
"Thou, Father, art in my heart and no one knows
thee but me, thy son."  "Cursed be the deceiver
who said 'I am the Son'," Issachar cried, and
drawing the knife from his belt was about to strike
him.  But he saw the red blood flowing on the white
robe.  "They shall look upon him whom they pierced
and shall mourn for Him as for a son," he recalled
the prophecy, and, throwing down the knife, flung
himself at the feet of the Pierced One, crying "Who
are you?"
</p>

<p>
"Ahiram, your uncle, who did you think I was?
Come, wake up, my son," he heard Ahiram's voice
and woke up.
</p>

<p>
"What is the matter with you, my boy?  Have
you had a bad dream?" the old man said, stroking
Issachar's hair affectionately.  "See, here is your
pass!"
</p>

<p>
He took a day tablet from his bosom and gave it
to Issachar: the king's seal&mdash;the sun disc of Aton&mdash;was
at the top, next to the date of the month and
below was the signature Tutankhaton.'
</p>

<p>
Issachar took the tablet and gazed at it, still
trembling, so that his teeth chattered.
</p>

<p>
"Give me the stone!" Ahiram said, looking at him
suspiciously, wondering if he would refuse payment.
</p>

<p>
Issachar took the stone out of his purse and gave
it to Ahiram.
</p>

<p>
"But why are you so frightened?  Have you
changed your mind?  Won't you go?" the old man
said.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I will go," Issachar answered.
</p>

<p class="dropcap">
Poor queen!  To give the god hot
fomentations when he has
stomach-ache and still believe that he
is a god is no joke," the old
courtier Ay said, laughing.
</p>

<p>
Tuta, who was very fond of
witty remarks, repeated it to Dio in a moment of
confidence, and she often recalled it as she looked at
Queen Nefertiti.
</p>

<p>
Mother of six children at the age of twenty-eight,
she still looked like a girl: slender girlish waist,
bosom only slightly marked, narrow shoulders, collar
bones that stood out under the skin, a thin long
neck&mdash;'like a giraffe's,' she used herself to say
jokingly.  The round face looked childishly tender under
the high bucket-shaped royal tiara, worn low over
the forehead so that no hair showed.  There was
something childishly piteous in the short slightly
protruding upper lip; there was an inward brooding
look and a fathomless depth of sadness in the big
lustreless, rather slanting black eyes under the heavy
drooping eyelids.
</p>

<p>
She seemed to be all on guard, as though listening,
spell-bound, to something within herself,
motionless as an arrow on the bow string or a chord
stretched to the uttermost but not sounding as yet;
if it did sound it would break.  It was as though
she had received a mortal wound and were concealing
it from all.
</p>

<p>
Daughter of Tadukhipa, a princess of Mitanni,
and Amenhotep the Third, king of Egypt, Queen
Nefertiti was King Akhnaton's half-sister: kings of
Egypt, children of the Sun, often married their
sisters in order to preserve the purity of the race.
</p>

<p>
The king and queen were so much alike that when,
as boy and girl, they used to wear almost the same
clothes, people found it hard to distinguish them.
There was the same languid charm about them, the
charm of a half-opened flower drooping with the
heat of the sun.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Oh plant that never tasted running water,<br>
  Oh flower, plucked out by the roots."<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Dio recalled the dirge for the dead god Tammuz
when she looked at the bas-relief of the king and
queen in one of the palace chambers.  They were
represented sitting side by side on a double throne;
she had her left arm round his waist, the fingers of
the right hand were intertwined with his fingers and
their faces were so close together that one could
hardly see her through him; he was in her and she
in him.  As it said in the hymn to Aton:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "When Thou didst establish the earth<br>
  Thou didst reveal thy will to me<br>
  Thy son Akhnaton Uaenra,<br>
  And to thy beloved daughter<br>
  Nefertiti, delight of the Son<br>
  Who flourishes for ever and ever!"<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
It was then that this brother's and sister's marriage
was made.
</p>

<p>
"They cannot be loved separately, they must be
loved together&mdash;two in one," Dio understood this at
once.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
After her dance on the day of Aton's Nativity,
she received the rank of 'the chief fan-bearer on
the right side of the gracious god-king' and, leaving
Tuta's house, settled in the palace where a room
was assigned to her in the women's quarters close
to the queen's chambers.  She soon made friends
with the queen, but a barrier which she herself could
not understand separated her from the king.
</p>

<p>
She was no longer afraid of his being 'not quite
human': she had learned from the queen that he
certainly was human.  There was profound meaning
in the flat joke about 'the god having stomach-ache.'  And
the horror that the king's blasphemous words
about being 'the son of God' had inspired in her at
the festival of the Sun had disappeared, too: all
kings of Egypt called themselves 'sons of God.'
</p>

<p>
She felt no fear, but something that was perhaps
worse than fear.
</p>

<p>
It used to happen in the autumn when she was
hunting on Mount Ida in Crete that on a bright,
sunny day mist suddenly crept up from the mountain
gorges, and the molten gold of the forest, the blue
sky, the blue sea grew dim and grey and the sun
itself looked out of the fog like a dead fish's eye.
"What if the Joy of the Sun, Akhnaton, also looks
at me with the eyes of a dead fish?" she thought.
</p>

<p>
She danced for him every day, and he admired
her.  "Only a dancer&mdash;I will never be anything more
for him," she said to herself, with a grey fog of
boredom in her mind.
</p>

<p>
She stood for hours behind the king's throne,
raising and lowering with a slow, measured movement,
in accordance with the ancient ritual, the big
ostrich-feather fan on a long pole.  Sometimes when
left alone with her he turned suddenly and smiled at
her with such appealing tenderness that her heart
stood still at the thought that he would speak and
the barrier would fall.  But he said nothing or spoke
about trifles: asked whether she was tired and would
like to sit down; or wondered at the quickness with
which she had learned to wave the fan&mdash;an art more
difficult than it appeared; or, with jesting courtesy,
blessed the stupid old custom of keeping cool in
winter and fanning away the non-existent flies
because it gave him a chance of being with her.
</p>

<p>
One day Dio was reluctantly&mdash;she did not like
talking about it&mdash;telling the queen who questioned
her how she had killed the god Bull on the Knossos
arena to avenge a human victim, her best friend,
Eoia; how she had been sentenced to be burned and
was saved by Tammuzadad, the Babylonian, who
went to the stake in her place.
</p>

<p>
The king was present, too, and seemed to listen
attentively.  When Dio finished there were tears in
the queen's eyes, but the king, as though coming to
himself suddenly, glanced at them both with a strange
quiet smile, and muttered hurriedly and excitedly,
repeating the same words, as he often did:
</p>

<p>
"You mustn't shave it off!  You mustn't shave it
off!"
</p>

<p>
It was so inappropriate that Dio was alarmed
and wondered if he were ill.  But the queen smiled
calmly and said, laying her hand on Dio's head:
</p>

<p>
"No, certainly not: it would be a pity to shave
such beautiful hair!"
</p>

<p>
It was only then that Dio remembered that she
had asked the queen a day or two ago whether she
ought to shave her head and wear a wig, as the
custom in Egypt was.
</p>

<p>
After saying these sudden words the king went
out and the queen, as though apologizing for him,
said that he had not been very well lately.
</p>

<p>
It took Dio some time to forget that at that moment
she had caught a glimpse of the decrepit monster
of Gem-ton&mdash;that the sun looked through the
fog like a dead fish's eye.
</p>

<p>
The same evening when he was left alone with
her, he got up suddenly, put his hands on her
shoulders and brought his face near hers, as though he
would kiss her; but did not&mdash;he merely smiled so that
her heart stood still: she recalled the girl-like boy
with a face as gentle as the face of the god whose
name is Quiet-Heart.
</p>

<p>
A man dreams sometimes a dream of paradise, as
though in sleep his soul had returned to its heavenly
home; and on waking he cannot believe that it has
been a dream only, cannot get used to his earthly
exile and is full of sadness and yearning: such was
the sadness in his face.  The long lashes of the
drooping eyelids, as though weighed down with sleep,
seemed moist with tears, but there was a smile on
the lips&mdash;a trace of paradise&mdash;heavenly joy shining
through earthly sorrow like the sun through a cloud.
</p>

<p>
"I heard everything you said this afternoon, only
I did not want to speak before her: one may not
speak about this to anyone.  You know this, don't
you?" he asked, looking at her with the same smile.
</p>

<p>
"I know," Dio answered.
</p>

<p>
"Darling, how good it is that you came, how I
have been waiting for you!"
</p>

<p>
He brought his face still nearer so that their lips
almost touched.
</p>

<p>
"Do you love me?" he asked as simply as a child.
</p>

<p>
"I love you," she answered, as simply.
</p>

<p>
And it was a joy like a dream of paradise that he
left her without a kiss.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
On the following day, the eleventh after Aton's
nativity, Dio was standing with her fan behind the
queen's chair in the palace-chamber of the Flood,
in which the flooding of the Nile was depicted.
</p>

<p>
The morning sun shone through the melting mist
of the clouds into the square opening of the ceiling,
adorned with faience wreaths of vine, with dark red
clusters of grapes and dark blue leaves.  The tiled
walls were painted with water-flowers and plants,
the pillars, shaped like sheaves of papyrus, had for
capitals figures of wild geese and ducks hanging head
downwards&mdash;the spoils of river hunting; the paintings
on the floor represented a backwater on the Nile;
fishes swam among the blue, wavy lines of the river,
butterflies fluttered among the lotos thickets,
ducklings flew up, and an absurd spotted calf galloped
about with its tail in the air.  As it said in the
morning hymn to Aton:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "The earth rejoices and is glad<br>
  All cattle graze in pastures green,<br>
  All plants are growing in the fields.<br>
  The birds are flying o'er their nests,<br>
  And lift their wings like hands in prayer,<br>
  Lambs leap and dance upon their feet.<br>
  All winged things fly gaily round,<br>
  They all live in thy life, O Lord!"<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The king was playing with his six daughters:
Meritatona, Makitatona, Ankhsenbatona, Neferatona,
Neferura and Setepenra.  The eldest was fifteen,
the youngest five and there was a year's difference
between the others.  When they stood in a row
to say their prayers, their smoothly shaven
egg-shaped heads&mdash;royal marrows&mdash;formed a series of
descending steps, like the reeds on a shepherd's pipe.
</p>

<p>
The four elder girls were dressed in shifts of
transparent linen&mdash;'woven air'&mdash;and the two youngest
were quite naked.  Their arms and legs, thin as
sticks were almost brown; they wore heavy gold
rings in their ears and broad necklaces of crystal
and chrysolite tears arranged like rays round their
necks.
</p>

<p>
The king's dwarf, Iagu, took part in the games;
he came of the wild tribe of Pygmies, Ua-Ua, who
lived like monkeys in the trees of the marshy forests
in the extreme South.  Two feet in height,
bow-legged, fat-bellied, black, wrinkled, old and
monstrous like the god Bes, the primaeval monster, he
looked ferocious but was in truth as mild as a lamb;
he was a splendid dancer and an unwearying nurse
to the princesses who loved and tormented him; a
faithful servant of the king's household, he would
have gladly died for each and all of them.
</p>

<p>
First they played 'nine-pins,' rolling ivory balls
through reed hoops so as to knock down at one blow
nine wooden dolls with ugly faces&mdash;nine kings
hostile to Egypt.
</p>

<p>
Then Iagu's pupil, the trained white poodle, Dang,
with a cap of fiery red feathers on its head and ruby
earrings, jumped through a hoop and walked on its
hind legs, holding a marshall's staff in its front paws
and a piece of antelope meat on its nose, not daring
to swallow it until Iagu cried "eat."
</p>

<p>
Then they went into the winter hot-house garden,
where there were rare foreign flowers and an
ornamental pool with floating lotuses, and made two
dreadful monsters of clay&mdash;the Babylonian king,
Burnaburiash and his son, prince Karakardash, who
wanted to marry the eight year old princess
Neferatona.  The king was so smeared with clay that he
had to be washed in the pool.
</p>

<p>
Then they amused themselves with the cock&mdash;the
bird, unknown in Egypt, had just been brought from
the kingdom of Mitanni; upset by its long journey,
the cock ruffled its feathers in gloomy silence, but
suddenly flapped its wings and crowed for the first
time so loudly that all were frightened and then
delighted&mdash;'a regular trumpet'!&mdash;and began to imitate
him; the king did it so badly that the girls laughed
at him.
</p>

<p>
Then they returned to the chamber and played
blind man's buff.  Iagu caught the king, who then
had his eyes bandaged.  The girls jumped about and
scurried to and fro under his very nose, strummed
on citherns, stamped with their bare feet on the floor,
imitating the oxen threshing and sang a song:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Hey!  Hey!  Hey!<br>
  It's fine and fresh to-day,<br>
  Fine workmen, oxen,<br>
  Work, work away!<br>
  Stamp upon the threshing floor!<br>
  You'll have something for your trouble.<br>
  We'll have the grain and you the straw!"<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
The king, awkwardly spreading out his arms, kept
catching empty air or embracing pillars.  At last he
caught Ankhi, Tuta's twelve year old wife.
</p>

<p>
"You moved the bandage," she cried.  "There, the
left eye is peeping out!  You mustn't cheat, abby!"
</p>

<p>
'Abby' was the diminutive from the Canaan word
<i>Abba</i>&mdash;father.
</p>

<p>
"No, I haven't, it slid off," the king tried to
justify himself.
</p>

<p>
"You have moved it, you have!" Ankhi kept on
shouting.  "I know you, abby, you are a dreadful
little rogue!  But that's not the way to play.  You
must catch again."
</p>

<p>
She bandaged his eyes tighter than before and
he had to catch them again.
</p>

<p>
The poodle, Dang, as though also playing, walked
about on its hind legs holding a sounding cithern
in its front paws.  The king, imagining from the
sound, that it was the little Zeta&mdash;Zetepenra&mdash;bent
down rapidly and threw his arms round Dang.  The
dog barked and licked him in the face.  The king
cried out in alarm, sat down on the floor and pushed
Dang away.  But it rushed up to him again, put
its front paws on the king's shoulders and licked
him squealing with delight.
</p>

<p>
All laughed and shouted.
</p>

<p>
"Abby has kissed Dang!  Doggy has made friends
with the king."
</p>

<p>
The queen laughed, too.
</p>

<p>
"There, you've done enough fanning, sit down
and rest," she said to Dio, and Dio sat down at
the foot of her chair.
</p>

<p>
"The kingdom is for the children," she suddenly
recalled aloud the king's words that she had heard
from little Ankhi.
</p>

<p>
"The kingdom is for the children," the queen
repeated.  "And do you know how it goes on?"
</p>

<p>
"How?"
</p>

<p>
"What is most divine in men?  Tears of the wise?
No, laughter of children."
</p>

<p>
"So this is why the god Aton has children's
hands for rays?" Dio asked.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, the whole of wisdom is in this: what is
childlike is divine," the queen answered and, gently
placing her hand on Dio's head, looked straight into
her eyes.
</p>

<p>
"How is it you are so pretty to-day?  Have you
fallen in love by any chance?" she said,
smiling&mdash;'quite like him&mdash;' Dio thought.
</p>

<p>
"Why fallen in love?" she asked, smiling, too.
</p>

<p>
"Because when girls are in love they grow
particularly pretty."
</p>

<p>
Dio shook her head, blushed and bending quickly
down, caught the queen's hand and began kissing
it eagerly, as though she were kissing him through
her.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly she felt the queen's hand tremble.  Raising
her eyes and seeing that the queen was looking
at the door, she, too, looked in the same direction.
Merira, son of Nehtaneb, the high priest of the god
Aton, was standing in the doorway.
</p>

<p>
Dio had been struck by his face at the festival
of the Sun and since then she often looked at him
wondering whether she felt repelled or attracted by
him.
</p>

<p>
He somewhat resembled Tammuzadad: there was
the same stony heaviness about their faces; but
there had been something childlike and piteous in
the Babylonian's face, while Merira looked
hopelessly grown up.  There was a stony heaviness in
the low overhanging brows, in the eyes immoveably
intent and yet, as it were, unseeing, the wide
cheekbones, the firmly set jaw and the tightly closed lips
that seemed sealed with bitterness and were always
ready to jeer, though they could never smile.
</p>

<p>
"He that increases knowledge increases sorrow,"
Dio recalled Tammuzadad's words as she looked at
that face.  "To know all is to despise all," it seemed
to say, "not to curse, but merely to despise in secret,
to spew out of one's mouth."  If a very courageous
man firmly determined on suicide had drunk poison
and then calmly awaited death, his face would wear
the same expression.
</p>

<p>
Merira came of a very old family of the Heliopolis
priests of the Sun.  He had once been the
favourite pupil of Ptamose and an ardent devotee
of Amon; but he gave up the old faith and
worshipped Aton.  The king was very fond of him.
"You alone have followed my teaching, no one else
has," he said, when he conferred on Merira the rank
of high priest.
</p>

<p>
Merira came in while the king was sitting on the
floor and the poodle, Dang, with its paws on his
shoulders, was licking his face and the princesses
were laughing and shouting.
</p>

<p>
"Abby has kissed Dang!  Doggie has made friends
with the king."
</p>

<p>
Merira probably failed to notice the queen and
stopped in the doorway looking intently at the king.
The queen, bending slightly forward and craning
her neck, looked at Merira as intently as he did at the
king.
</p>

<p>
"Merira, Merira!" she cried suddenly and there
was fear in her eyes.  "Why do you look at the
king like that, do you want to cast a spell over him?"
she laughed, but there was fear in her laughter.
</p>

<p>
He slowly turned to her and made the low
ceremonial bow, bending down from his waist and
stretching out his hands, palms upwards.
</p>

<p>
"Rejoice, queen Nefertiti, the delight of the Sun's
delights!  I have come to call the king to the Council.
It seems I have come at the wrong moment."
</p>

<p>
"Why wrong?  Go and tell the king."
</p>

<p>
Merira went up to the players.  Laughter died
down.  The king jumped up and looked at him with
a guilty smile.
</p>

<p>
"What is it, Merira?"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing, sire.  You were pleased to call the
Council for to-day."
</p>

<p>
"Oh yes, the Council!  I had forgotten.....
Well, let us go, let us go!" he hurried.
</p>

<p>
The bandage he had round his eyes during the
game was dangling on his neck; he tried to pull it
off, but could not&mdash;it got tied into a knot.  Ankhi
went up to him, undid the knot and took off the
bandage, while Rita&mdash;Meritatona&mdash;put on his head
the royal tiara he had taken off for the game.
</p>

<p>
The girls' faces fell.  The poodle slightly growled
at Merira and the dwarf made funny and frightful
faces at him behind the king's back.  It was as
though a shadow had come upon everything and
the sun had grown dim and looked like a 'fish's eye.'
</p>

<p>
As the king walked past the queen and Dio he
looked at them dejectedly and resignedly like a
schoolboy going to a dull lesson.
</p>

<p>
Dio glanced at the queen.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, follow him," she said, and Dio followed the
king.
</p>

<p>
He looked round at her with a grateful smile and
Merira looked at them both with his usual mute
derision.
</p>

<p class="dropcap">
The three walked into the Council
Chamber.  The dignitaries had long
been gathered there waiting for
the king.  When he passed by them
they prostrated themselves, sniffed
the ground under his feet and,
raising their shaven, egg-shaped heads stretched
out their hands palms upwards, saying:
</p>

<p>
"Rejoice, Akhnaton, Joy of the Sun!"
</p>

<p>
Tuta, as usual, surpassed them all.
</p>

<p>
"My king, my god, who hast made me, grant me
to enjoy the sight of thy face forever!" he
exclaimed, rolling his eyes so ecstatically that
everyone envied him.
</p>

<p>
The king sat down in his chair on a low alabaster
platform between four pillars.  Dio stood behind
him with the fan.
</p>

<p>
All looked at her curiously.  She felt she was
already regarded as the king's mistress; she flushed
and looked down.
</p>

<p>
A bodyguard of Hittite amazons stood in the
depths of the many pillared room.  The dignitaries
sat on their heels in a semicircle on mats on the
floor; only three sat on folding chairs: Tuta, Merira,
and the commander-in-chief and king's vizier,
Ramose, a heavy fat old man of seventy, with a
red puffy face, like an old woman's, a courtly smile
on his lips and small eyes lost in fat, very kind and
intelligent.
</p>

<p>
Grandson of General Amenemheb, fellow-soldier
of the great Tutmose the Third, the Conqueror, he
had covered himself with glory in the different
campaigns he led against the wild tribes of Kush and
the Sinai nomads.  He had been promoted to the
rank of Vizier under King Amenhotep the Third,
Akhnaton's father, and the people were fond of him
and called him 'a just man.'  He would have given
his life for the king, but he regarded the new faith
in Aton and the betrayal of the old gods as madness
and disaster.  "The best and most unfortunate of
kings," he used to say about Akhnaton, "he is
ruining himself and his kingdom for nothing."
</p>

<p>
The sitting of the Council began.  The king listened
to the officials' reports about the failure of
crops, famine, rebellions, brigandage, robberies,
bribe-taking, secessions of provincial governors and
feuds between them.
</p>

<p>
Standing slightly on one side Dio could see his
face.  He listened with his head bent and his face
seemed expressionless.
</p>

<p>
The chief of the guards, Mahu, reported on the
last rising&mdash;the one in Thebes.
</p>

<p>
"Very likely nothing would have happened had
not the Lybian mercenaries joined the rebels," he
said in conclusion.
</p>

<p>
"And why did they join them?" the king asked.
</p>

<p>
"Because their salary was not paid in time."
</p>

<p>
"And why was it not paid?"
</p>

<p>
"At the prince Viceroy's orders."
</p>

<p>
The king looked at Tuta.
</p>

<p>
"Why did you do it?"
</p>

<p>
"I have laid the king's yoke upon my neck and
here I bear it," Tuta began, wondering what kind
of answer he had better give: he understood that
someone had informed against him.  "If I go up
to heaven or come down to earth my life is always
in thy right hand, O King!  I look here and I look
there and I see no light; I look upon thee, my king,
my sun, and behold, here is light!  A brick may
move from under other bricks in a wall but I shall
not move from under the feet of my king, my
god...."
</p>

<p>
"Make haste and tell me why you did it," the
king interrupted him impatiently.
</p>

<p>
"There was no money to buy bread for the starving
and so I borrowed it from the Lybians' salary."
</p>

<p>
The king said nothing, but gave him such a look
that Tuta lowered his eyes.
</p>

<p>
"How many killed?" asked the king, turning to
Mahu again.
</p>

<p>
"Less than a hundred," he answered.
</p>

<p>
He knew that more than two thousand had been
killed, but, exchanging glances with Ramose,
understood that the truth should not be told: the king
would be unhappy and perhaps fall ill and nothing
would be gained by it&mdash;everything would remain
as before.
</p>

<p>
"A hundred people!" the king whispered, bending
his head still lower.  "Well, you won't have long
now....."
</p>

<p>
"Not long to do what, sire?" Ramose asked.
</p>

<p>
"To kill people in my name!" the king answered
and then asked, after a pause: "Is there a letter from
Ribaddi?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, there is."
</p>

<p>
"Show it me."
</p>

<p>
"I cannot, sire, it is an unseemly letter."
</p>

<p>
"Never mind, show it."
</p>

<p>
Ramose gave him the letter.  The king read it
first to himself and then aloud so calmly that it
might have been written about someone else:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="quote">
"Ribaddi, Viceroy of the King of Egypt in Canaan, thus
speaks to the King: for ten years I have been sending to
thee for help but thou hast not helped me.  Now Azini,
an Amorite, a traitor, has risen against thee and gone
over to the king of the Hittites.  And they have gathered
together chariots and men to conquer Canaan.  The enemy
is at my gates, to-morrow they will enter and kill me and
throw my body to the dogs.  Well does the King of Egypt
reward his faithful servants!  May the gods do the same
unto thee as thou hast done unto me.  My blood is on thy
head, traitor!"
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"How dares this dead dog insult our god-king!"
Tuta said, with indignation.
</p>

<p>
The king looked at him again, and he subsided.
</p>

<p>
"Has Ribaddi perished?" the king asked.
</p>

<p>
"He has," Ramose answered.  "He threw himself
on his sword so as not to fall into the enemies'
hands alive."
</p>

<p>
"What will happen now, Ramose?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, this, sire: the king of the Hittites will have
Canaan; the thieves will undermine the wall and
enter the house.  We were for four hundred years
under the yoke of the nomads, and we may be for
another four hundred under the yoke of the
Hittites.  Your great-grandfather, Tutmose the Great,
made Egypt the head of all nations and we were the
light of the world and now this light is no more...."
</p>

<p>
"What are we to do then, Ramose?"
</p>

<p>
"You know yourself, king."
</p>

<p>
"Begin war?" the king asked.
</p>

<p>
Ramose made no answer; he knew that the king
would perish and ruin his kingdom rather than begin
war.
</p>

<p>
The king was silent, too; he seemed lost in
thought.  Suddenly he raised his head and said:
</p>

<p>
"I cannot!"
</p>

<p>
He paused again, thinking, and repeated:
</p>

<p>
"I cannot; no, I cannot!  'Peace, peace to the
far and the near,' says my heavenly father, Aton.
'Peace is better than war; let there be no war, let
there be peace!'  This is all I know, all I have,
Ramose.  If you take this from me, there will be
nothing left: I shall be destitute, naked, dead.  Better
kill me outright!"
</p>

<p>
He spoke simply and quietly; but Dio's heart
throbbed again as on the day before in the joy of
the heavenly dream.  She suddenly recalled the
huge pale phantom of Cheop's pyramid shimmering
in the rosy sunlight mist over the yellow sands of
the desert: the perfect triangles&mdash;"I began to be as
one god, but three gods were in Me," in the words
of the ancient wisdom&mdash;divine triangles getting
narrower and narrower, more and more pointed as they
rose to heaven and in the very last point the same
frenzied ecstacy as in Akhnaton's quiet word 'Peace'!
</p>

<p>
"O, how sweet is thy teaching, Uaenra," Tuta
thrust himself forward again&mdash;like the poodle Dang
licking the king in the face.  "You are the second
Osiris, conquering the world by peace and not by
sword.  If you say to the water 'let there be
peace'&mdash;there shall be peace."
</p>

<p>
"Listen, Ramose," the king began, "I am not
such a scoundrel as Ribaddi thought, and I am not
such a fool as Tuta takes me to be...."
</p>

<p>
The poodle Dang got a flip on the nose: he was
alarmed and upset.  But he was soon comforted by
Ay&mdash;an old dignitary with intelligent, cold and
cynical eyes, who sat next to him.
</p>

<p>
"Don't bother, it isn't worth it," he whispered in
Tuta's ear.  "You see he is playing the fool again,
the crazy saint!"
</p>

<p>
"I am not such a fool as Tuta thinks," the king
went on.  "I know there will be no peace on earth
for a long time to come.  There will be endless war,
and the longer it goes on the fiercer it will be: 'all
will be killing each other' as the ancient prophecy
says.  There has been a flood of water&mdash;there is
going to be one of blood.  But even so, even so, let
men know that there has been in the world a man
who said 'peace'!"
</p>

<p>
He suddenly turned to Merira.
</p>

<p>
"What do you think, Merira?  Why do you smile?"
</p>

<p>
"I think, sire, that what you say is good, but it
is not all.  God is not only peace...."
</p>

<p>
He spoke slowly, with an effort, as though
thinking of something else.&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"But also what?" the king said to help him.
</p>

<p>
"Also war."
</p>

<p>
"What are you saying, my friend?  War is not
of God, but of the devil."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, of God, too.  Two sides of the triangle
meet at one point: day and night, mercy and wrath,
peace and war, Son and Father&mdash;all the opposites
are in God...."
</p>

<p>
"Is the Son against the Father?" the king asked
and his hand that was holding the arm of the chair
trembled slightly.
</p>

<p>
Merira raised his eyes to him and smiled so
strangely that Dio thought 'madman!'  But he
looked down again at once and his face turned to
stone, grew heavy with a stony heaviness.
</p>

<p>
"Why do you ask me?" he answered calmly.
"You know it all better than I, Uaenra: does not
the Son know the Father?  God is the measure of
all things.  I say it not to you but to others: seek
for measure in everything&mdash;in peace as in the sword."
</p>

<p>
"Quite so!  Quite so!" Ramose cried.  "I am
no friend of yours, Merira, but for this saying I
am ready to bow down at your feet&mdash;it couldn't be
said better!"
</p>

<p>
"Why are you so pleased with it?" the king
asked, looking at Ramose in surprise.  "What he
says is very dreadful."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, dreadful, but necessary," Ramose answered.
"Ankh-em-Maat, You-Who-live-in-Truth,
you want to lift truth up to heaven and spread it
throughout the earth; but men are weak, stupid
and wicked.  Be merciful to them, O King, don't
ask too much of them.  If you fix a ladder for them
they will climb up, but if you say 'fly,' they will fly
headlong into the pit.  There is no getting on with
mercy only: our mercy merely smooths the way for
evildoers.  We talk much and we do little, but
believe an old man like me: nothing in the world is
more wicked than empty good words, nothing more
vile than empty noble words."
</p>

<p>
"Are you speaking of me, Ramose?" the king
asked, with a kind smile.
</p>

<p>
"No, not of you, Uaenra, but of those who demand
a miracle of you and do not stir a finger themselves.
For twenty years I have served faithfully the king,
your father, and you; I have never told lies and I am
not going to now.  Things are going ill in your
whole kingdom, they are going very ill, O King!
We say 'peace,' but there is war, we say 'love,' but
there is hatred, we say 'light,' but there is darkness
instead."
</p>

<p>
He got up heavily, fell at the king's feet and
wept: "Have pity, sire; have mercy!  Save yourself,
save Egypt, take up the sword for right and
justice.  And if you do not want to do it, I don't
want to see you ruin yourself and your kingdom
any more.  Let me retire, I am old and want a
rest!"
</p>

<p>
The king bent down to him and lifting him up
embraced and kissed him on the lips.
</p>

<p>
"No my friend, I will not let you go, and you
would not go yourself&mdash;you are fond of me...
Bear up a little longer, the time is getting
short&mdash;I shall soon go myself," he whispered in his ear.
</p>

<p>
"Go where?  Where?" Ramose asked with prophetic terror.
</p>

<p>
"Don't speak, don't ask, you will soon know
everything!" the king answered and got up,
showing that the Council was over.
</p>

<p class="dropcap">
Leaving the Council Chamber, they
went to the Beggars' Court.  Telling
the courtiers to go on, the king
lagged behind so as to remain
alone with Dio.  Passing through
a number of rooms they came into
a small hothouse garden where incense trees brought
from the far-away Punt, the land of the gods, grew
in pots of earthenware, like huge heather plants fine
as cobweb, dropping amber rosin tears in the warm
sunshine.
</p>

<p>
The king sank down on a bench and sat for some
minutes in silence without moving.  He seemed to
have forgotten Dio's presence, but suddenly he
looked at her and said:
</p>

<p>
"Shame!  Shame!  Shame!  You have looked
enough at my shame, go away!"
</p>

<p>
Dio knelt down before him.
</p>

<p>
"No, sire, I will not go away from you.  As the
Lord lives and as my soul lives, whither my king
goes, to shame or to honour, there will his servant
go also."
</p>

<p>
"You have seen me put to shame once, now you
will see it again.  Let us go," the king said,
getting up.
</p>

<p>
They entered the Beggars Court.
</p>

<p>
Three times in the year&mdash;when the Nile
overflowed, at seed time, and at harvest&mdash;the palace gates
were opened to all; every beggar could go in freely,
merely giving his name to Mahu, the chief of the
guards.  Tables with bread, meat and beer were
placed in the courtyard: everyone could eat and
drink his fill.  It was there that the king received
petitions and heard complaints.
</p>

<p>
During the first years of Akhnaton's reign these
feasts were more frequent.  "Let every ninth day
of the month be a day for beggars," it said in the
king's decree.  Governors of provinces were on that
day to distribute to the hungry corn from the king's
granaries "for the cry of the needy has come up unto
heaven and our heart is sore."  "Amon is the god of
the rich and Aton the god of the poor," the king
preached.  "Woe unto you, you sleek and rich who
acquire house after house and field after field, so
that there is no room on the earth left for others!
Your hands are full of blood.  Wash, cleanse yourselves,
learn to do good.  Save the oppressed, defend
the orphan, protect the widow.  Provide bread for
the hungry, water for the thirsty, clothes for the
naked, shelter for the homeless, smiles for the
weeping.  Undo the bondsmen's yoke and set the slaves
free: then shall your light shine in darkness and
your night shall be as midday!"
</p>

<p>
"Ankh-em-maat, You-Who-live-in-Truth," the
king's disciples said to him, "you will make the poor
equal with the rich, will efface the boundaries
between fields as the river flood effaces them.  You
are a multitude of Niles, flooding the earth with
the waters of inexhaustible love!"
</p>

<p>
The king had invented a dangerous game of
throwing gold to the beggars like fire into straw.
For many years Mahu, the chief of the guards, had
saved the situation: collecting trustworthy people
from among the palace servants he dressed them up
as beggars and promised the well-behaved a fair
share of the spoils and the unruly&mdash;the lash; and all
had gone well.  The king was short-sighted; from
the High Place where he sat while throwing the
gold money rings into the crowd, he could not
recognize the faces below.
</p>

<p>
But someone informed against Mahu.  The king
was very angry and nearly dismissed him from his
post; and next time Mahu had to admit real, not
dressed up beggars.  Then there was trouble: no
sooner did the rain of gold begin to fall than people
grew savage, a free fight began and a whole detachment
of armed soldiers had difficulty in quieting
the crowd.  There were three killed and many
wounded.  The king fell ill with grief, gold rained
no more, but food was still given away and petitions
received.
</p>

<p>
The Beggars Court was a large quadrangle paved
with slabs of alabaster and surrounded by two
storeys of pillared arcades.  At one end of it was
the High Place&mdash;the king's tabernacle.  A wide,
gradually ascending staircase of alabaster led to it.
The goddess, Nekhbet, the Falcon Sun-mother, with
a white head and a red, scaly body, was soaring
above the tabernacle holding a golden ring&mdash;the
royal globe, in its claws.  "As the mother comforts
her children so will I comfort you," the king, son
of the Sun, said to the sorrowful children of the
earth.
</p>

<p>
"Down! down! down! the king comes!  The god
comes!" the runners cried and the whole crowd in
the court prostrated themselves, crying out:
</p>

<p>
"Rejoice, Akhnaton, Joy of the Sun!"
</p>

<p>
Besides beggars and petitioners there were, in
the crowd, many sick, blind, halt and lame, because
people believed that everyone who touched the king's
clothes or upon whom his shadow fell was healed.
</p>

<p>
"Defend us, save us, have mercy, O Lord!" they
called to him, like the souls in hell to the god who
came down to them.
</p>

<p>
The king ascended the steps to the tabernacle
and sat on his throne.  Dio stood behind him with
the fan.
</p>

<p>
The guards admitted the petitioners through a
narrow passage between two low walls of stone
along the foot of the stairs.  Two Nubian soldiers
with naked swords guarded the door in the middle
of the wall adjoining the staircase.  Approaching
this door every petitioner prostrated himself, sniffed
the ground, placed a wooden or a clay tablet with
his petition on the bottom step of the stairs, where
there was a heap of them already, and passed
on.
</p>

<p>
Everyone was admitted into the Court, but a
special permit was required for entering the passage
leading to the king's tabernacle.  Mahu, the chief
of the guards, watched over everything.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly there was a disturbance.  A petitioner
tried to get through the little door.  The soldiers
crossed their swords in front of him but he went
straight ahead, stretching his arm towards the king
and screaming as though he were being cut to
pieces:
</p>

<p>
"Defend, save, have mercy, Joy of the Sun!"
</p>

<p>
Not daring to kill a man before the king, the
soldiers lifted their swords and the man, flattening
himself on the ground and wriggling like an eel,
crept between them and began crawling up the stairs.
Mahu rushed at him and seized him by the collar,
but the man wriggled out and went on screaming
and crawling towards the king.
</p>

<p>
Mahu made a sign to the lancers of the bodyguard
who stood two in a row, along the stairs.  They
closed their ranks and lowered their spears.  But the
man crawled on.
</p>

<p>
At the same moment a frenzied scream was heard:
</p>

<p>
"Let him through!  Let him through!"
</p>

<p>
The squealing, breathless scream like that of a
woman in hysterics or of a child in a fit was so
strange that Dio did not recognize the king's voice.
With a distorted face he jumped up and stamped
with both feet, as the little girls had done when
they played blind man's buff to the sound of the
threshing song.  And the ringing cry went on:
</p>

<p>
"Let him through!  Let him through!"
</p>

<p>
Mahu made another sign to the lancers and they
lifted their spears, making way.  The man crawled
between them and advanced almost as far as the
top landing where the king's tabernacle stood.  He
raised his head and Dio recognised the long red
curls, the red goat's beard, the prominent ears,
hooked nose, thick lips and burning eyes of Issachar,
son of Hamuel.
</p>

<p>
The king was quiet now and, bending forward,
looked straight into Issachar's eyes intently and, as
it were, greedily, just as Issachar looked at him.
</p>

<p>
"Your servant has a secret message for you, sire!"
Issachar whispered.
</p>

<p>
"Speak, I listen."
</p>

<p>
"No, for you, for you alone."
</p>

<p>
"Leave us alone," the king said to the dignitaries
who stood on the landing.
</p>

<p>
All withdrew except Dio who hid behind the corner
of the tabernacle.
</p>

<p>
Some three or four steps separated Issachar from
the king.  "I know who you are!  I know!" he said,
crawling up and looking straight into the king's
eyes, with the same intent, eager look.  "Sun's joy,
Sun's Only Son, Akhnaton Uaenra, Son of the
living God!"
</p>

<p>
Suddenly he jumped up and drew a knife from
his belt.  But before he had time to raise it Dio
darted forward and seized him by the hand.  He
pushed her so that she fell on her knees but jumped
up again, not letting go of his hand, and screening
the king with her body.  An unendurably burning
chill pierced her shoulder.  She heard shouts, saw
people running and fell on the ground with the
last thought: 'he will kill him!'

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-p.png" width="138" height="134" alt="P">
</div>

<p class="dropcap">
Paradise gardens of Maru-Aton&mdash;the
Precincts of the Sun&mdash;were
situated south of the city, where
the rocks of the hilly desert were
close to the river.
</p>

<p>
The sweet breath of the north
wind could be felt even on the hottest days under
the shade of the evergreen palms and cedars laden
with the fragrance of incense.  Each tree was planted
in a hole dug in the sand, filled with the Nile black
earth and surrounded by a ridge of bricks to
prevent water running away.
</p>

<p>
Everywhere there were flower-beds, ponds,
islands, bridges, arbours, chapels, summer houses of
light transparent lattice-work magnificently painted
and gilded like jewel boxes.
</p>

<p>
The king often came here to rest from the noise
of the city in the stillness of paradise.
</p>

<p>
Dio spent three months here recovering from her
wound.  Issachar hit her with the knife just above
her left breast.  It was a dangerous wound: had
the knife gone in deeper it would have touched the
heart.  During the first few days she suffered from
fever and delirium.
</p>

<p>
She fancied she was lying on the funeral pyre as
then, in the island of Crete after killing the god
Bull; the sacrificial knife pierced her heart; the
flames burnt her but through their heat she felt a
heavenly freshness: Merira was the flame and
Tammuzadad&mdash;the freshness.
</p>

<p>
Or she saw a fiery red goat grazing on the green
meadows of paradise; the grass turned coal-black
at his touch and red sparks flitted about it; and
again&mdash;Tamu was the green grass and Merira&mdash;the
sparks.
</p>

<p>
Or it was a rich old Sidonian merchant unfolding
before her among the booths of the Knossos harbour
magnificent stuff, red shot with green; winking
slyly he praised his goods: "a true robe of Baal!
A mine of silver per cubit is my last price."  And,
once more, the red shade was Merira, the
green&mdash;Tammuzadad.
</p>

<p>
Or, the real Merira was taking her into the holy
of holies of Aton's temple, as he really had done,
three days before Issachar's attack on the king; she
did not want to go in, knowing that no one but the
king and the high priest were supposed to do so, but
Merira reassured her, saying, "Yes, with me you
may!"  And, taking her by the hand, he led her in.
In the dim light of sanctuary lamps the bas-relief of
the Sphinx seemed a pale phantom: a lion's body and
legs, human arms and head and an inexpressibly
strange, fine, birdlike face&mdash;old, ancient, eternal.
"If a man had suffered for a thousand years in hell
and then came to earth again, he would have a face
like that," Merira whispered in her ear.  "Who is
he?" she tried to recognize him and could not; and
then, suddenly, she knew him and woke up with a
cry of unearthly horror: 'Akhnaton'!
</p>

<p>
The king's physician, Pentu, treated her so cleverly
that she was soon better.  But the unwearying care
of the queen did her more good perhaps than any
medicine.  The queen nursed Dio as though she
had been her own daughter; she never left her,
spent sleepless nights beside her though she herself
was far from well: she had a cough and every
evening there was an ominous red flush in her
cheeks.
</p>

<p>
Each time that Dio saw the wan, beautiful face
bending over her, the face of one who had also
received a mortal wound, she felt like bursting into
tears.
</p>

<p>
She learned from the queen what happened in
the Beggars Court after Issachar had struck her
and she fell down senseless.
</p>

<p>
"God has saved the king by a miracle!" everyone
said.  The assassin had raised his knife to strike
him when some dreadful vision appeared before him;
the knife dropped out of his hand and he fell at the
king's feet.  The king, thinking that Dio was killed,
bent over her and embraced her with a cry so
terrible that only then they understood how much he
loved her.  He would not leave her, but at last Pentu,
the physician, assured him that Dio was alive and
he got up, covered with her blood.
</p>

<p>
"You are now related by blood both to him and to
me," the queen said, smiling through tears.
</p>

<p>
Some of the bodyguards rushed at Issachar, intending
to kill him on the spot, but the others saved
him at the orders of Mahu and Ramose; only these
two had kept their presence of mind amidst the
general confusion and remembered that, before
putting the criminal to death, they ought to find
out from him whether he had any accomplices.
Issachar was taken to the prison and cross-examined,
but he said very little; he did not give anyone away
and only confessed that when he raised the knife to
strike the king he had a vision.  He would not say
what the vision was and only muttered to himself
something in the Jewish language about their
King-Messiah and repeated senseless words "they shall
look on Him whom they pierced."  But he would
not explain who was pierced and then grew silent
altogether.
</p>

<p>
Torture was forbidden by royal decree in the holy
province of Aton, yet considering the importance of
the occasion they had recourse to it all the same.
But neither antelope lashes nor hippopotamus
scourges could untie Issachar's tongue.  Mahu and
Ramose had to give him up at last.
</p>

<p>
On that same night he was taken ill with something
like brain fever&mdash;or pretended to be.  Fearing
that the criminal might die before the execution
Ramose hastened to ask the king for a death
penalty had been abolished in Aton's province.  And
when Ramose suggested that the criminal should be
moved to some other province and executed there,
the king smiled and said, shrugging his shoulders:
"there is no deceiving God, my friend!  This man
wanted to kill me here&mdash;and here he must be
judged."&mdash;"Not judged, but pardoned," Ramose
understood and was indignant; he decided to put
Issachar to death secretly by the hands of the gaolers.
But he did not succeed in this either: the old gaolers
were replaced by the new who had received strict
orders to preserve the prisoner's life.
</p>

<p>
Issachar soon recovered from his real, or pretended,
illness.  The king who had had an epileptic
fit after Issachar's attack on him and was still far
from well, visited the prisoner and had a long peaceful
talk almost alone with him: the guards stood at
a distance; and a few days later it appeared that
the prisoner had escaped.
</p>

<p>
The three elder princesses, Maki, Rita and Ankhi,
helped the queen to nurse Dio; it was from them she
heard of the city rumour about the king having
himself helped Issachar to escape; it was said that the
man had not gone far but was hiding somewhere
in the town waiting, perhaps, for a new opportunity
to take the king's life.
</p>

<p>
"The king has now shamed the faces of all his
faithful servants because he loves those who hate
him and hates those who love him!" Ramose cried
when he heard of Issachar's escape, and he recalled
the words of old Amenhotep the Wise, the tutor and
namesake of the king's father: "if you want to
please the gods, sire, and to cleanse Egypt from
corruption, drive away all the Jews!"
</p>

<p>
"The darling Hippopotamus is right," Ankhi
concluded&mdash;she called Ramose 'hippopotamus'
because of his being so stout&mdash;and suddenly she
clenched her fists and stamped almost crying with
anger.  "Shame, shame upon all of us that the vile
Jew has been spared!"
</p>

<p>
Dio made no answer, but the thought flashed
through her mind "we are related by blood now,
but blood, both his own and other people's is like
water to him!"  And though she immediately felt
ashamed of this thought a trace of it remained in
her mind.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The king often came to Maru-Aton, but the queen
seldom allowed him to see Dio, especially during
the first, difficult days: she knew he was not clever
with the sick.  His conversations with Dio were
strangely trivial.
</p>

<p>
"Why is it I keep talking of trifles?" he wondered
one day, left alone with her.  "Is it that I am
growing stupid?  You know, Dio, sometimes I am
awfully stupid, ridiculously so.  It must be because
of my illness...."
</p>

<p>
He paused and then added, with the childishly
timid, apologetic smile that always wrung her heart:
"The worst of it is that I sometimes make the most
sacred things foolish and ridiculous: like a thief
stealing and desecrating that which is holy...."
</p>

<p>
"Why do you talk like this?" Dio cried,
indignantly.
</p>

<p>
"There, forgive me, I won't....  What is it I
was going to say?  Oh, yes, about Issachar.  It
wasn't out of foolishness I pardoned him.  He is
a very good man...."
</p>

<p>
The queen came in and the conversation dropped.
Dio was glad: her heart was throbbing as though
Issachar's knife had once more been thrust into the
wound.
</p>

<p>
By the month of Paonzu, March-April, she was
almost well though still weak.
</p>

<p>
The first time she went into the garden she was
surprised to see that the hot summer came straight
after the winter: there was no trace of spring.
</p>

<p>
Strange longing came upon her during those hot
days of delusive southern spring.  "He who drinks
water out of the Nile forgets his native land," the
Egyptians said.  She fancied she, too, had forgotten
it.  What was this longing then?  "It's nothing,"
she tried to comfort herself, "it's simply foolishness,
the result of illness, as with the king.  It will pass
off."  But it did not.
</p>

<p>
In the gardens of Maru-Aton by the big pond
opposite the women's quarters where Dio lived, a
rare tree, hardly ever seen in Egypt, was planted&mdash;a
silver birch, graceful and slender, like a girl of
thirteen.  It had been brought as a present to
Princess Makitatona from Thracia, the land of
Midnight.  The princess was very fond of it; she looked
after it herself, watered it and kept the ground
around it well dug, covering it with fresh Nile black
earth.
</p>

<p>
Dio, too, grew fond of the birch tree.  Every
day she watched its buds swell and sticky, greenish
yellow leaves, crumpled like the face of a new-born
baby, open out; she kissed them and, sniffing them
with her eyes closed, fancied that every moment she
would hear the call of the cuckoo and smell the
melting snow and lilies of the valley as in her native
woods at home on Mount Ida&mdash;smell the real spring
of her own native land.
</p>

<p>
When flocks of cranes flew northwards, with their
melancholy call, she stretched out her arms to them:
would that she, too, were flying with them!  Looking
at the ever blue, lifeless sky she longed for the
living clouds she knew so well.  Putting her ear to
a shell, she eagerly listened to its roar, that was like
the roar of sea waves; she dreamt of the sea in her
sleep and wept.  One day she sniffed a new sponge
Zenra had just bought and almost cried in reality.
</p>

<p>
She had a Cretan amethyst, a present from her
mother, with a fine design upon it: bare willows in
a flooded meadow all bent to one side by the wind,
a tumble-down old fence with poles sticking out,
the ripple of autumn rain on the water: everything
dull and wretched and yet she would have given her
very soul to see it all again.  But she knew she
would never see it, she would never go home&mdash;she
would not want to herself.  Was this, perhaps, why
she longed for it so?  Thus the radiant shades in
paradise may be longing for this gloomy earth.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
One early morning she sat by Maki's birch tree,
listening to the wailing of the shepherd's pipe in the
hills above Maru-Aton.  She knew both the song
and the singer: the song was about the dead god
Tammuz and the singer was Engur, son of
Nurdahan, a Babylonian shepherd, an old servant of
Tammuzadad, brought by her to Egypt from the
island of Crete.
</p>

<p>
The sounds of the pipe fell sadly and monotonously,
sound after sound like tear after tear.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "The wail is raised for Tammuz far away,<br>
  The mother-goat and the kid are slain,<br>
  The mother-sheep and the lamb are slain,<br>
  The wail is raised for the beloved Son."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Dio listened and it seemed to her that in this song
the whole creation was weeping for the Son who is
to come, but still tarries "how long, how long, O
Lord?"
</p>

<p>
Nothing stirred and complete stillness reigned
everywhere; only the air, in spite of the early hour,
was simmering with heat over the sandy paths of
the garden and flowing in streams like molten glass.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly a fan-like leaf at the top of a palm
moved as though coming to life, then another and
a third.  There was a gust of wind, hot as from an
oven; the sand on the paths rose up like smoke; the
light grew dim; the sky turned dark and yellowish
in an extraordinary, incredible way: it might be the
end of the world; the whole garden rustled and
groaned in the sudden whirlwind.  It was dark as
night.
</p>

<p>
Dio ran home.  The wind almost knocked her off
her feet, burned her face, blinded her with sand.
Her breath failed her, her temples throbbed, her
legs gave way under her.  It was not twenty paces
to the house but she felt she would fall exhausted
before she got there.
</p>

<p>
"Make haste, make haste, dear!" Zenra shouted
to her from the steps; seizing Dio by the hand she
dragged her into the entry, and with difficulty
shutting the door in the tearing wind, bolted it fast.
</p>

<p>
"What is it, nurse?" Dio asked.
</p>

<p>
"Sheheb, a plague of Set," the old woman answered
in a whisper, putting the palms of both hands
to her forehead as in prayer.
</p>

<p>
Sheheb, the south-east wind, blows from the
Arabian desert.  Fiery clouds of sand, thrown up
by the whirlwind, fall slanting upon the ground with
the noise of hail.  The sun turns crimson, then dark
like an ember.  At midday lamps have to be lit.
Neither men nor animals can breathe in the black
stuffy darkness; plants perish.  The whirlwind
never lasts more than an hour; if it lasted longer
everything would be burned up as with fire.
</p>

<p>
In the fiery darkness of the Sheheb Dio lay on
her couch like one dead.  The wind howled outside
and the whole house shook as though it would fall.
Someone seemed to be knocking and throwing handfuls
of sand at the closed shutters, the flame of the
lamp flickered in the wind that penetrated through
the walls.
</p>

<p>
The door opened suddenly and someone came in.
</p>

<p>
"Zenra, is it you?" Dio called.
</p>

<p>
There was no answer.  Somebody approached
the couch.  Dio recognized Tammuzadad and was
not frightened or surprised, she seemed to have
expected him.  He bent over her and smiled; no, it
was not Tamu, but Merira.  She looked closely and %
again it was Tamu and then Merira again; first
it was one then another; they interchanged and
merged into one another like the two colours of a
shot material.  He bent down still lower, looked
into her eyes as though asking a question.  She
knew that if she answered 'no' with her eyes only
he would go away; but she closed her eyes without
speaking.  He lay down beside her and embraced
her.  She lay like one dead.
</p>

<p>
When he had gone away she thought "I will go
and hang myself."  But she went on lying quite
still.  She may have dropped asleep and by the time
she woke up the Sheheb was over, the sky was clear
and the flame of the lamp looked pale.  Zenra came
in and Dio understood that it had been delirium.
</p>

<p>
After the Sheheb the weather freshened.  The
sweet breath of the north wind could be felt in the
shade of the evergreen palms and cedars fragrant
like a censer of incense.  Only at times a smell of
carrion came from the direction of Sheol and then
Dio thought of her Sheheb nightmare.  It was the
last attack of her illness.  The wound healed so
completely that the only trace left of it was a pale
pink scar on the dark skin, and Dio was quite well.
</p>

<p>
The king had once given her a beautiful scroll
of papyrus, yellowish like old ivory, smoothed to
perfection with wild boar's tooth, fine, strong,
imperishable.
</p>

<p>
Papyrus was expensive and only used for the
most important records; everything else was written
on clay or wooden tablets, flat white stones or
fragments of broken earthenware.
</p>

<p>
Dio had been wondering for some time what
would be good enough to write on this scroll; at
last she thought of something.
</p>

<p>
All the king's teaching was given by word of
mouth; he never wrote down anything himself and
did not allow others to do so.  "To write," he used
to say, "is to kill the word."
</p>

<p>
"It will all be lost, it will vanish like a footprint
on the sand," Dio often thought sorrowfully, and
at last she decided: "I will write down on the
papyrus the king's teaching; I will not disobey him:
no one living now shall see the scroll; but when I
have finished writing I will bury it in the ground;
perhaps in ages to come men will discover it and
read it."
</p>

<p>
She carried out her plan.
</p>

<p>
In secret from all she worked night after night,
sitting on the floor in front of a low desk with a
sloping board for the papyrus, tracing upon it, with
the sharpened end of a reed, close columns of
hieroglyphics, abbreviated into shorthand, and covering
each column with cedar varnish which made the
writing indelible.

"The god rejoices when he goes into battle and sees blood"
is said in the inscription of King Tutmose the Third, the
Conqueror, to the god Amon.  Amon is the god of war, Aton
the god of peace.  One must choose between them.  I have
chosen."

The king said to me alone and told me not to repeat it to
anyone:
</p>

<p class="quote">
"I am the joy of the Sun, Akhnaton?  No, not joy as yet,
but sorrow; not the light, but the shadow of the sun that is
to rise&mdash;the Son!"
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Dio wrote down many other words of the king
in her scroll and she finished with the hymn to Aton:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="quote">
The Song of King Akhnaton Uaenra Neferheperura to Aton,
the living and only God.
</p>

<p class="quote">
If my scroll is ever found by you, men of the ages to come,
pray for me in gratitude for having preserved this song for
you, the sweetest of all the songs of the Lord, that at the
everlasting supper I may eat bread with my beloved King
Akhnaton, the messenger of the rising sun&mdash;the Son.
</p>

<p class="poem2">
  Glorious is thy rising in the east<br>
  Lord and giver of life, Aton!<br>
  When thou risest in the sky<br>
  Thou fillest the earth with thy beauty.<br>
  Thy rays embrace all created things,<br>
  Thou hast carried them all away captive.<br>
  Thou bindest them by thy love.<br>
  Thou art far but thy rays are on earth,<br>
  Thou art on high, thy footprints are the day.<br>
  When thou settest in the west<br>
  Men lie in the darkness like the dead.<br>
  Their heads are wrapped up, their nostrils stopped<br>
  Stolen are all their things that are under their heads<br>
  While they know it not.<br>
  Lions come forth from their dens,<br>
  Serpents creep from out their holes:<br>
  The Creator has gone to rest and the world is dumb.<br>
</p>

<p class="poem2">
  Thou risest and bright is the earth<br>
  Thou sendest forth thy rays and the darkness flees.<br>
  Men rise, bathe their limbs, take their clothing,<br>
  Their arms are uplifted in prayer.<br>
</p>

<p class="poem2">
  And in all the world they do their work.<br>
  All cattle graze in pastures green,<br>
  All plants are growing in the fields,<br>
  The birds are flying over their nests,<br>
  And lift their wings like hands in prayer.<br>
  Lambs leap and dance upon their feet,<br>
  All winged things fly gaily round.<br>
  They all live in thy life, O Lord!<br>
</p>

<p class="poem2">
  The boats sail up and down the river,<br>
  Every highway is open because thou hast dawned.<br>
  The fish in the river leap up before thee<br>
  And thy rays are in the midst of the great sea.<br>
</p>

<p class="poem2">
  Thou createst the man-child in woman,<br>
  And makest the seed in man,<br>
  Givest life to the child in its mother's womb,<br>
  Soothing it that it may not weep<br>
  Ere its own mother can soothe it.<br>
</p>

<p class="poem2">
  When the chicken cries in the egg-shell,<br>
  Thou givest it breath to preserve it alive<br>
  And the strength to break the shell.<br>
  It comes forth from the egg and staggers,<br>
  But with its voice it calls to thee.<br>
  How manifold are thy works, O Lord!<br>
  They are hidden from us, Thou only God whose power no<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;other possesses!<br>
  Thou didst create the earth according to thy desire,<br>
  While thou wast alone in eternity,<br>
  Thou didst create man and the beasts of the field,<br>
  All the creatures that are upon the earth,<br>
  And fly with their wings on high.<br>
</p>

<p class="poem2">
  Thou didst create Syria, Nubia and Egypt,<br>
  Setting every man in his place.<br>
  Giving him all that he needs,<br>
  His measure of food and his measure of days.<br>
  Their tongues are diverse in speech,<br>
  Their forms are diverse and their skins,<br>
  For Thou, divider, hast divided the peoples.<br>
</p>

<p class="poem2">
  Thou makest the Nile in the nether world<br>
  To fill with goods thy people here;<br>
  Thou hast set a Nile up in the sky,<br>
  That its waters may fall down in floods,<br>
  Giving drink to wild beasts on the hills,<br>
  And refreshing the fields and the meadows.<br>
  How excellent are thy works, O Lord!<br>
  The Nile in heaven is for the strangers,<br>
  And the Nile from the nether world is for Egypt.<br>
</p>

<p class="poem2">
  Thou feedest each plant as thine own child,<br>
  Thou makest the seasons for all thy creatures:<br>
  The winter to bring them coolness<br>
  And the summer to bring them heat.<br>
</p>

<p class="poem2">
  Thou didst create the distant heavens<br>
  In order to behold all that Thou didst make.<br>
  Thou comest, thou goest, thou comest back<br>
  And Greatest out of thyself, the Only One,<br>
  Thousands upon thousands of forms:<br>
  Cities, towns and villages<br>
  On highways and on rivers.<br>
  All eyes see thy eternal sun.<br>
  When thou hast risen they live, when thou settest they die,<br>
  When thou didst establish the earth<br>
  Thou didst reveal thy will to me,<br>
  Thy Son, Akhnaton, who lives for ever and proceeds from thee,<br>
  And to thy beloved daughter,<br>
</p>

<p class="poem2">
  Nefertiti, the delight of the Sun's delights.<br>
  Who flourishes for ever and ever.<br>
  Thou, Father, art in my heart<br>
  And there's no other that knows thee,<br>
  Only I know thee, thy son,<br>
  Akhnaton Uaenra,<br>
  Joy of the Sun, Sun's only son!"<br>
</p>

<p>
</p>

<p>
When she had finished writing, Dio put the scroll
inside an earthenware vessel, sealed it with a leaden
seal with the sun disc of Aton and, as soon as it was
dark, took a spade and went to Maki's birch tree by
the big pond in the garden.
</p>

<p>
The fiery whirlwind of Sheheb had withered the
tree, the blackened leaves were rolled up into little
tubes, but the roots were alive.  Maki dug it out to
move it to a new hole with fresh earth in it, but
she probably had not had time to finish her work
before night: the tree lay near the hole.
</p>

<p>
Dio dug the hole deeper, put the earthenware pot
into it, covered it with earth and levelled it.
</p>

<p>
A white rose was blooming close by in a flowerbed
by the pond.  In the stillness of the April night
glowworms flitted about like sparks.  One of them
burrowed its way into the rose, and the flower
seemed to have a heart of fire.
</p>

<p>
Dio went up to it, kissed it and thought:
</p>

<p>
"If some day men read my writing, they will
connect Akhnaton with Dio.  I shall be in him as
this flame is in the flower."

</div>

<p class="dropcap">
The whip cracked, the horses dashed
forward, the feathers on their
manes swayed, snowflakes of foam
dropped off their bridles, and the
chariot flew like a whirlwind.  The
air whistled in the ears; the lion's
tail fixed to the king's belt at the back and the
crimson ribbons of his robe fluttered in the wind.  The
king was driving; Dio stood behind him.
</p>

<p>
They passed the palm groves and the fields of
ripe, yellow corn, taller than the height of man; the
Nile glittered for the last time in the distance and
the menacing silence of the endless desert, now dark
brown, now sparkling like glass, enveloped them.
</p>

<p>
As she looked through her lashes at the shining
snake-like sandy roads, flattened by heavy traffic,
Dio recalled the thin layer of ice over the thawing
snow sparkling in the sun on Mount Dicte.  The
dazzling air was shimmering with the heat.  A vulture
hung motionless in the dark blue sky.  At times
the shadow of a passing cloud ran over the ground
and, still quicker, an antelope galloped past; suddenly
it would stop and, stretching out its neck, sniff
the air and then run on, light as the wind.
</p>

<p>
The sun was setting when the wayfarers saw on
a high rock of the Arabian hills a boundary-stone of
the province of Aton.
</p>

<p>
The images of King Akhnaton and Queen Nefertiti,
cut out in the rock at a height where only the
wind, the sun and the eagles could reach them, were
half-covered, as though buried alive, by the waves of
drifting sands.  The only way to reach the bas-reliefs
was to descend by a rope down a perpendicular rock;
and evidently this was what some enemy of Aton's
faith had done, for the images were broken and
defiled.
</p>

<p>
The king stepped out of the chariot.  The long
black shadow cast by his figure upon the white sand
seemed to stretch to the ends of the earth.
</p>

<p>
There was a clatter of hoofs.  The high-priest,
Merira, and the chief of the guards, Mahu, drove up.
</p>

<p>
"If I could only find the scoundrels, I would kill
them on the spot!" Mahu cried indignantly, when
he saw the desecrated images.
</p>

<p>
"Come, come, my friend," said the king, with a
smile.  "The sands will bury them anyway&mdash;there
will be nothing left."
</p>

<p>
Mahu went to make arrangements for the night:
the king wished to sleep in the desert.
</p>

<p>
Close by there was a mountain gorge, dark and
narrow like a coffin, where tombs had been cut in
the rock for the princesses.  Hard by an old fig-tree
made an unfading patch of green against the dead
sand, and a sweetbrier flowered, fragrant with the
scent of honey and roses: the secret water of an
underground spring kept them fresh.
</p>

<p>
The king, accompanied by Dio and Merira, went
down into the gorge to see the tombs.
</p>

<p>
When they had finished they walked up the slope
of the hill by a narrow jackals' path, talking.
</p>

<p>
"Is the decree concerning the gods ready, Merira?"
the king asked.
</p>

<p>
Dio understood that he meant the decree
prohibiting the worship of all the old gods.
</p>

<p>
"It is ready," Merira answered, "but do think
before you proclaim it, sire."
</p>

<p>
"Think of what?"
</p>

<p>
"Of not losing your kingdom."
</p>

<p>
The king looked at him intently, without speaking,
and then asked again:
</p>

<p>
"And what ought I to do, my friend, not to lose
my kingdom?"
</p>

<p>
"I have told you many times, Uaenra: be merciful
to yourself and others."
</p>

<p>
"To myself and others?  Can one do both?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"And what do you think, Dio?"
</p>

<p>
"I think one cannot."
</p>

<p>
Merira looked at her from under his brows, with
mute derision.
</p>

<p>
"Do you remember, Merira, who it was said:
'I know the day when I shall not be'?" the king
asked.
</p>

<p>
"I remember: the god Osiris."
</p>

<p>
"No, the man Osiris.  It is the will of the Father
that the Son should suffer and die for all.  Blessed
be my heavenly Father!  I, too, know the day when
I shall not be.  It is drawing near&mdash;it has come
already.  Now my kingdom is coming to an end, now
fulfil the last will of your king, Merira, son of
Nehtaneb, and proclaim to men my decree concerning
the false gods and the one true God, whose
is the glory for ever and ever!"
</p>

<p>
"Your will shall be done, sire, but remember:
once the fire is kindled, there is no putting it out."
</p>

<p>
"Why, did you think we should just play with the
fire and then let it out?" the king said, with a smile.
He put both his hands on Merira's shoulders and
again looked deep into his eyes.
</p>

<p>
"I know what makes you wretched, Merira," he
said quietly, almost in a whisper.  "You have not
yet decided whether you are my friend or my enemy.
Maybe you will decide very soon.  Remember one
thing: I love you.  Don't be afraid then, my friend,
my beloved enemy; be my friend or my enemy to
the bitter end.  God help you!"
</p>

<p>
He put his arms round him and kissed him.
</p>

<p>
The chariot was brought.  The king stepped into
it and Dio followed him.  The whip cracked, the
horses dashed off and the chariot flew like the
whirlwind.
</p>

<p>
Merira watched it go, and when it disappeared in
the last rays of the setting sun he stretched out his
arms towards it and cried:
</p>

<p>
"You have prophesied your own doom, Akhnaton
Uaenra: now your sun is setting, now your kingdom
is coming to an end!"
</p>

<p>
It was already dark when, having driven far into
the hilly desert, the king stopped and alighted from
the chariot.  Dio tied the horses to a spear stuck in
the sand.  The king sat down on a stone and Dio
sat at his feet.
</p>

<p>
He pointed out to her the distant flame of a bonfire
in the desert.
</p>

<p>
"What is it?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"Mahu, strange man that he is...." the king
answered.  "He follows me about like a watchdog;
I suppose he is afraid of my running away...."
</p>

<p>
Both were silent: Dio was waiting for him to
speak: she knew he had come with her to the desert
in order to talk undisturbed.
</p>

<p>
"I want to ask you something, Dio, and I cannot,
I can't find the words," he began quietly, without
looking at her.
</p>

<p>
He broke off and then began lower still:
</p>

<p>
"Do you know what Iserker said to me when I
asked him why he wanted to kill me?  'Because,
being a man, you make yourself God'.  This was well
said, wasn't it?"
</p>

<p>
"No, it wasn't: you don't make yourself God."
</p>

<p>
"I know I don't: it would be better for a man
who made himself God not to have been born.  But
that's one thing and then there is something else;
and one thing is so like the other that sometimes
there is no distinguishing them....  And then it
turns round all of a sudden: it was like this and
then, all at once, it's the other way about...."
</p>

<p>
He rambled on incoherently, constantly losing the
thread of his thought, wandering off the point and
trying to find words; at last he was in a complete
tangle and, with a wave of his hand, said hopelessly:
</p>

<p>
"No, I cannot!  I will tell you another time...."
</p>

<p>
Dio smiled, and, taking his hand began kissing
and stroking it gently, comforting him like a child.
</p>

<p>
"Better tell me now, Enra!"
</p>

<p>
'Enra' was the diminutive of 'Uaenra' and only
those most intimate with him called him so.
</p>

<p>
"You speak very well, I understand it all.  You
don't make yourself a god, that's one thing, and
what was the other?" she tried to help him as though
he were a schoolboy who had forgotten his lesson.
</p>

<p>
"What was the other thing?" he began again
and suddenly hurried on joyfully.  "Do you remember
the prayer 'Thou, Father art in my heart and
no one knows Thee but me, Thy son?'  I have
said this and I don't go back on it.  I never shall.
This is as fixed in me as the stars in heaven.  But
this is so when I am not afraid, and when I am
afraid, I pray to the Father: 'send someone else,
someone else instead, I cannot!'  And now, too, I
am afraid.  I keep thinking of the burden I have
taken upon myself.  Can a man bear it?  What do
you think, can he?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know, Enra...."
</p>

<p>
"Don't you know either?"
</p>

<p>
The way he looked at her wrung her heart.
</p>

<p>
She clasped his knees and cried: "Yes, I do know:
you can&mdash;you alone!"
</p>

<p>
He said nothing and buried his face in his hands.
There was a long silence.
</p>

<p>
The stars came out.  The Milky Way like a cloud
rent in two stretched from one end of the desert
to the other; the Pleiades glowed and the seven stars
of Tuart, the Hippopotamus, glittered with a cold
brilliance.
</p>

<p>
The king uncovered his face and looked at Dio.
His face was as still as the sleeping desert and the
starry heavens above.  But Dio shuddered: she
recalled the Sphinx with the face of Akhnaton; if
a man had been tortured for a thousand years in
hell and then came to earth again, he would have
such a face.
</p>

<p>
"Dio, my sister, my beloved, why did you come to
me, why did you love me?" he said, wringing his
hands.  "It was easier for me without you: I did
not know myself then, did not see myself.  For
the first time I saw myself in you and was terrified:
who am I? who am I?  Go away, I beg you!  Why
should you be tortured with me?"
</p>

<p>
"No, my brother, I shall never go away from you,
I want to suffer with you!"
</p>

<p>
"You have escaped one fire and now you seek another?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I want to perish in your fire!"
</p>

<p class="dropcap">
The days of the floods were approaching.
</p>

<p>
The black, parched, withered
earth, deathlike and terrible was
aching under the terrible sun; the
waters of the Nile barely covered
its slimy bed.  Men, animals, and plants were perishing
with the heat.  Had the heat lasted, everything,
it seemed, would have been burnt up as with the fire
of a conflagration or of the Sheheb.
</p>

<p>
But at the exact day, at the exact hour, God's
miracle took place: Mother Isis wept over her dead
son&mdash;the dried-up Nile; her tear&mdash;the star Sirius,
the forerunner of the sun&mdash;fell into it and the
ram-headed Khnum unsealed the springs of water.
</p>

<p>
Frogs croaked joyfully; herons paced about the
black mud as though measuring the earth like the
wise god Tot, the Measurer; the clerks of the Water
Department measured the height of the water from
the Waterfalls to the Delta by the marks on the
stone walls of the measuring wells, while simple
folk did it by the crocodile eggs and ant-heaps: the
water never rose above these.  Twelve cubits meant
the ruin, sixteen cubits the salvation of Egypt.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
At that time Merira went to Nut-Amon, Thebes,
to see Ptamose who was at death's door and implored
him not to delay.  But even when Merira had arrived
in Thebes he kept putting off the meeting, as though
he feared it.
</p>

<p>
He, too, was ill; he could not sleep at night and
in the daytime he wandered about the town, not
knowing what to do with himself.  A grimace of
disgust was constantly upon his face as though he
smelt an evil stench.  This was one of the curious
torments of his illness: he was everywhere pursued
by bad smells&mdash;of dead rats as in a granary, of bats
as in the burials caves, or of rotten fish as on the
banks of the Nile where fish is cleaned, salted and
dried in the sun.  No perfumes were of any use:
they only made the stench worse.
</p>

<p>
Some three days after his arrival he was sitting
by the eastern gates of the Apet-Oisit enclosure,
among the ruins of the tomb-sanctuary of King
Tutmose the Third.
</p>

<p>
The sun was in the zenith: its rays came down
straight almost without casting any shadow.  The
dreadful light poured down like molten tin.  Merira
sat in the narrow shadow cast by the crown of the
giant pillar that had fallen&mdash;the double head of the
Heifer-Hather.  The shadow at his feet diminished
so rapidly that one could almost see it: only a minute
before he had been all in the shadow and now the
sun was burning his feet.  He saw a scorpion running
in the dusty grass but he did not stir, he seemed
spellbound.  There was a dull pain in his left temple,
as though a fishbone had pierced the eyeball.  He
felt rather sick, and there was a taste of death in
his mouth.
</p>

<p>
Black dots like flies, swam about in the air, that
quivered with the heat, and turning into transparent
glassy maggots melted away.  One of them began
to grow and became an ancient Sphinx, with the
face of Akhnaton; if a man had suffered for a
thousand years in hell and then came to earth again
he would have a face like that.  He slowly swam
past and melted away, then came back again, turned
thick and heavy and stood on all fours; his hind legs
were those of a lion but the front were human arms.
He ran along making a hideous clatter with his
claws.
</p>

<p>
As though breaking with a terrible effort invisible
bonds on his arms and legs, Merira regained
consciousness, got up and walked away.
</p>

<p>
By the same subterranean passages which Dio
had trodden, he descended into the large, low-pitched
sepulchral chamber, or sanctuary, supported by low
quadrangular columns.  A couch stood in the middle;
a corpse lay upon it.
</p>

<p>
The vaulted niche in the wall where once Amon's
great Ram had lain on a couch of purple in the
brilliant light of sanctuary lamps, was dark and
empty: the animal had just died and its body was
being embalmed.
</p>

<p>
Merira told the two priests who were in the room
to go out, and, approaching the couch with the dead
man upon it, knelt down, bending towards him.  The
dead man opened his young, living, immortal eyes;
his lips whispered with the rustle of dry leaves:
</p>

<p>
"Is it you, Merira?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"Blessed be the True, the Only God!  I have
waited seven years for you, my son, I knew that you
would come&mdash;that I would not die without seeing
you.  Why did you tarry so long?  Did you think I
would not forgive you?  I will forgive everything.
Well, tell me, are you with him or with me?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, if I only knew, if I only knew, father!  This
is why I have suffered so for seven years&mdash;because
I don't know on whose side I am.  Perhaps I am
neither with you nor with him."
</p>

<p>
"There is no middle course."
</p>

<p>
"To an honest man there is not, but to a vile one
anything is possible.  For seven years I have done
nothing but deceive myself and others.  Don't
torment me, father, don't ask me, decide yourself on
whose side I am!"
</p>

<p>
"If I do you will not believe me.  Do you remember
your oath?"
</p>

<p>
"What are oaths to me?  I have broken them long ago."
</p>

<p>
"No, you wanted to break them but you could not.
You know yourself, there is no room for both of
you in the world, it is either you or he.  If you don't
kill him, you will kill yourself."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, perhaps I will.  Or, first him and then
myself....  Can one kill the man one loves, father?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  To kill the body in order to save the soul."
</p>

<p>
"Well, that is how it will be with me, or perhaps
it will be different: I will kill him not out of love
but out of envy.  A beggar envies a rich man, a
scoundrel envies a noble one, the dead envy the
living.  Set killed Osiris, his brother, from envy.
And how can I help envying him?  He is&mdash;and I
am not: he is alive and I am dead He kills me, he
destroys me for ever and ever!"
</p>

<p>
"Why have you not come before?  What have
you been doing with him?"
</p>

<p>
"What have I been doing?  I thought I should
get the better of him, deceive him, catch him in my
net, but instead...."
</p>

<p>
He broke off and asked, with a wry smile:
</p>

<p>
"Was it good, father, that Set killed Osiris?"
</p>

<p>
"Why do you ask?  You know yourself: they, the
blind puppies, think it was not good.  Osiris is life
and Set is death for men, but for us, the wise ones,
this is not so.  The Tormented one torments, the
Slain one slays, the Destroyed one destroys the
world.  Osiris-Amenti is the eternal West, the sun
of the dead, the end of the world: he will rise over
the world and the sun of the living will be
extinguished; the god with an unbeating heart will
conquer the world and the heart of the world will cease
to beat.  He is merciful and he ensnares the world
with his mercy as a bird-catcher ensnares a bird.  He
says 'everlasting life' and, behold, there is everlasting
death.  Set and Osiris have been struggling since
the beginning of the world, but the world does not
yet know which of the two shall conquer."
</p>

<p>
"You speak almost exactly as he does, father! the
tiniest hairbreadth divides you from him...."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, there is only a hairbreadth difference
between truth and falsehood.  Do you know the secret?
The first Osiris has been, the second is to come; this
man is but a shadow cast by Him; this one has
spoken but the One to come will act."
</p>

<p>
"What will He do?"
</p>

<p>
"Destroy the world."
</p>

<p>
"Or perhaps the world will perish for His sake
and be happy in doing so?"
</p>

<p>
"And will you be happy, too?"
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps I, also."
</p>

<p>
"Do you love Him, then?"
</p>

<p>
"I do.  How can one help loving Him?  He is
more beautiful than all the sons of man.  The devil
knew well how to tempt man.  I love His shadow,
too, King Akhnaton; I love and hate him at the
same time.  And he knows it&mdash;he knows I want to
kill him...."
</p>

<p>
Without speaking Ptamose took a ring off his
finger and put it on Merira's.
</p>

<p>
King Tutmose the Third, King Akhnaton's
great-great-grandfather, gave this ring to Hatuseneb, the
high priest of Amon.  A tiny cup of poison was
concealed under the fiery yellow carbuncle&mdash;'Amon's
eye.'  On his deathbed the king commanded that if
any king of Egypt were false to Amon he was to
be killed with that poison.
</p>

<p>
"My spirit be upon you, my son, and the Spirit
of the Secret One!" Ptamose said, laying his hands
on Merira's head.  "Henceforth, you, Merira, son of
Nehtaneb, are the High Priest of Amon.  Woe to
thy enemies, O Lord!  Their dwelling-place is in
darkness but the rest of the earth in thy light: the
sun of them that hate thee is darkened, the sun of
them that love thee is rising!"
</p>

<p>
He ceased speaking, closed his eyes, and for a few
minutes lay without moving.  Suddenly a faint tremor
passed over his body.  He heaved a deep, deep sigh;
his chest rose, then sank and did not rise again.  But
there was no change in his face.
</p>

<p>
Merira watched him for some time, unable to
tell whether he were alive or dead.  He took his
hand&mdash;it was cold; he felt his heart&mdash;it did not
beat.
</p>

<p>
He called the priests and said:
</p>

<p>
"The great seer&mdash;Urma, the prophet of all the
gods of the south and the north, the high priest of
Amon, Ptamose, has ascended to the gods!"

<p class="dropcap">
Now we have begun, we must finish;
it is no use crying over sour milk,
as an intelligent girl said once,
having done something that could
not be put right," said Ay, a court
dignitary, and everyone laughed.
</p>

<p>
"How soon will the decree for destroying the gods
be published?" Tuta asked.
</p>

<p>
"In ten days or so," Parennofer, the Keeper of
the King's Seal, replied.
</p>

<p>
"Couldn't we hurry it?  It will be the beginning,
you know...." Tuta said.
</p>

<p>
"It may be the beginning of such things that
nothing will be left of us," muttered Ahmes, the
superintendent of the king's household.
</p>

<p>
"What is it you are afraid of?" Tuta asked.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, anything!  It's no joke going against the gods...."
</p>

<p>
"Well, the gods can fend for themselves, but we
must think of our own skins.  In this accursed hole,
Aton's province, we are like mice in a trap&mdash;there is
no way of escape.  They will slaughter us like sheep
when the levelling begins."
</p>

<p>
"What levelling?"
</p>

<p>
"Don't you know?  The king thinks of nothing
but making the rich and the poor equal.  But what if
the mob does rise up in earnest?"
</p>

<p>
"No, I am not particularly afraid of the mob,"
Ahmes replied.  "The mob may very likely be on our
side, but our own sort, the officials, will cut off our
noses in a trice."
</p>

<p>
"'Better have a head without a nose than a nose
without a head,' as a smart fellow said who had
had his nose cut off," Ay said, and everyone laughed
again.
</p>

<p>
"And what are we to do with Saakera?" Parennofer
asked.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing at all; his Ethiopian woman will deal
with him," Ay answered.
</p>

<p>
Saakera, the heir-apparent, had three hundred and
sixty-five wives, according to the number of days in
the year, one more beautiful than the other, but he
was said to prefer to them all an old, hideous and
bad-tempered Ethiopian who, so the rumour ran,
used to box his ears and do what she liked with
him.
</p>

<p>
"One can't trust anyone," Ahmes concluded, looking
round at them all suspiciously.  "Do you remember
the words of King Amenemhet?  'Do not trust
your brother, do not commune with your friend,
for in the day of fear no one will stand by you.  I
gave alms to the poor and bread to the hungry; but
he who ate my bread lifted his heel against me.'  And
someone else, too, has said rather cleverly 'where
there are six conspirators, there is one traitor.'"
</p>

<p>
They all looked at one another in silence: there
were more than six of them.
</p>

<p>
They were on the top floor of Tuta's summer-house,
which had just been built but was not yet
inhabited; no one could disturb them there: the
garden surrounding it was under water during the
flooding of the Nile, so that the house had to be
approached by boat.
</p>

<p>
On meeting each guest, Tuta led him to the
washing-stand, then showed him to a seat on the wide
and low couch that ran the whole length of the room
and was covered with carpets, offered him the
fragrant cup for the head and moved towards him the
stand with cooling drinks in Tintyrian vessels of
porous clay.
</p>

<p>
The night was dark and hot, a hot wind smelling
of water, river mud and fish, blew in sudden gusts;
it set up its mournful song, that sounded like a
wolf's howl or a child's cry, somewhere very
far-off&mdash;at the end of the world, it seemed&mdash;then drew
nearer and nearer and suddenly came in a fearful
gust, whistling, squealing, roaring and moaning
furiously, and stopped as suddenly; all that could be
heard was the splash of water against the walls of
the house and the rustle of palm leaves like a whisper
behind the windows.
</p>

<p>
During one of these quiet intervals the door opened
noiselessly and a huge black cat, half-panther, walked
in like a shadow.  Going up to Tuta it began rubbing
itself against his legs, purring loudly.  He got up to
shut the door when Merira came in.
</p>

<p>
Tuta ran forward to meet him and was going to
bow down to the ground before the high priest of
Amon; but Merira embraced him and kissed him on
the mouth.  Tuta offered him the seat of honour, but
Merira sat down on the floor beside him, slowly
looked at them all and said, with a quiet smile:
</p>

<p>
"Go on, gentlemen, I listen."
</p>

<p>
"It is for you to speak, father; it shall be as you
say," Tuta replied.
</p>

<p>
"No, decide for yourselves.  Do all know what
we have met for?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"Well, then there is nothing more to say."
</p>

<p>
"It is no use crying over sour milk," Ay repeated,
adding, after a pause, "It is better that one man
should die for all than that the whole people should
perish."
</p>

<p>
"Who will give him the cup?" Merira asked.
</p>

<p>
"Three people can give it him in virtue of our
office, you, I or Tuta," Ay answered.  "Hadn't we
better draw lots?"
</p>

<p>
The cat looking at the narrow stone-trellised
chink-like window, right under the ceiling, was mewing
savagely.  Suddenly it made a huge leap across the
room like a real panther, jumped up to the window,
and holding on to the stone bars with its claws, thrust
its head against it and tried to put its paw through,
but could not: the trellis was too close.  Mewing
still more furiously and plaintively it jumped to the
floor and rushed about the room, its black body
smooth and slippery like a snake.
</p>

<p>
"What's the matter with the cat?" Merira asked.
"Has it gone mad?  See the way it bares its teeth!
And its eyes glow like candles.  Ugh, the devil!
Fancy keeping a reptile like that in the house.  Take
care Tuta&mdash;it will go for your throat one day when
you are asleep!"
</p>

<p>
"I expect it smells someone," said Ay, looking at
the window.
</p>

<p>
"But who can be there?  There is water all
round&mdash;no one could get through.  A bird or a monkey
perhaps," said Tuta.
</p>

<p>
The wind that had just been roaring stopped again
suddenly and everything was so still that one could
hear the water splashing against the walls of the
house and the palm leaves rustling.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps it's they?" Parennofer whispered, turning pale.
</p>

<p>
"Who?" Tuta asked.
</p>

<p>
"The restless.  It's not for nothing they desecrate
the tombs nowadays.  They say there are a lot of
evil spirits going about at night."
</p>

<p>
"Oh please, please don't talk about it!" Tuta
implored, his stomach beginning to ache with fear.
</p>

<p>
"Drive it away, I beg you," Merira cried, with
disgust.
</p>

<p>
Tuta seized the cat by the collar and tried to
drag it out of the room.  But it would not go and he
was scarcely able to master it; at last, however he
succeeded, and bolted the door behind it.  But the
cat went on scratching and mewing outside the
room.
</p>

<p>
"Let me see, what were we talking about?" Merira
began again.
</p>

<p>
"About casting lots," Tuta reminded him.
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  I don't know how it strikes you, gentlemen,
but it seems to me that it is unworthy of
intelligent men to be the slaves of chance.  Let us
decide freely.  Ay, do you want to give the poison?
No?  Tuta?  Nor you either?  Very well, then I
will."
</p>

<p>
In the depths of the room there was an altar of
bronze with a folding wooden image of King
Akhnaton sacrificing to the Sun god.  Merira went up
to it, took the image and hit it against the corner of
the bronze altar so violently that it broke in two.
</p>

<p>
"Woe to thy enemies, O Lord!  Their dwelling
place is in darkness and the rest of the earth in thy
light; the sun of them that hate thee is darkened
and the sun of them that love thee is rising.  Death
to Akhnaton Uaenra, the apostate!"
</p>

<p>
All repeated, joining hands over the altar:
</p>

<p>
"Death to the apostate!"
</p>

<p>
Merira led Tuta by the hand to the armchair and
making him sit in it, said:
</p>

<p>
"The high priest of God on high, Amon-Ra, the
king over all other gods, the prophet of all the gods
of the south and the north, the great seer of the
sky, Urma Ptamose, commanded me, on his death-bed,
to elect king of all the earth Tutankhamon, the
son of King Nebmaar Amenhotep, the son of Horus.
Do you all agree, men and brethren?"
</p>

<p>
"We agree.  Long live Tutankhamon, King of Egypt!"
</p>

<p>
Neferhepera, the master of the king's wardrobe,
gave Merira a golden serpent of the Sun, Uta.
</p>

<p>
"By the power given me of God, I crown thee
King of Egypt," Merira said, placing it on Tuta's
head.
</p>

<p>
"Long live the King!" they all cried, prostrating
themselves.
</p>

<p>
Merira's face was suddenly distorted.
</p>

<p>
"The cat again!" he whispered, looking into a
dark corner of the room.
</p>

<p>
"The cat?  Where?" Tuta asked, looking quickly
about him.
</p>

<p>
"There, in the corner, do you see?"
</p>

<p>
"There is nothing there."
</p>

<p>
"No, there is not.  I must have fancied it."
</p>

<p>
He moved his hand across his face and smiled.
</p>

<p>
"Zahi, Heheki&mdash;they are winged panthers, with a
falcon's head, a human face on the back, a budding
lotos instead of a tail and a belly covered with sharp
teats like the teeth of a saw.  They say there are a
lot of these unclean creatures prowling about at
night....  But perhaps they don't exist?  Old
women's tales .... Heheki, heheki," he laughed
suddenly, with a laugh so dreadful that Tuta felt a
shiver running down his back.
</p>

<p>
"There, there, again, look!  But this time it is not
a cat&mdash;it is he, Uaenra!  Do you see what a face he
has&mdash;worn out, old, eternal.  If a man had suffered
for a thousand years in hell and then came back
again, he would have a face like that ... he looks
at me and laughs&mdash;he knows I want to kill him but
he thinks I won't dare....  But wait a bit, I'll show
you!"
</p>

<p>
He staggered and almost fell.  They all rushed to
him and would have bled him, but he had already
recovered.  His face was almost calm; only the corners
of his mouth quivered and his lips were twisted
into a smile.
</p>

<p>
All of a sudden there was a frantic squealing and
howling outside the window; the leaves rustled and
something fell into the water with a heavy splash.
</p>

<p>
They all ran to the ground floor hall which gave
on to the garden and saw the cat floating on the
water with its belly ripped open.
</p>

<p>
"It's a bad business," Ay said.
</p>

<p>
"Why!" Merira asked.
</p>

<p>
"Someone has been eavesdropping."
</p>

<p>
"What of it?"
</p>

<p>
"What of it?  Why, he will tell the king."
</p>

<p>
"Let him.  I know the king better than you do:
he might hear with his own ears, see with his own
eyes and yet not believe.  He would hand the spy
over to us."
</p>

<p>
"Hadn't we better put it off," Tuta began timidly;
the fright had given him such a stomach-ache that
he could hardly stand and could not spare a thought
even for his beloved Ruru.
</p>

<p>
"Let's put it off!  Let us!" everyone said.
</p>

<p>
"Cowards, scoundrels, traitors!" Merira cried in
a fury.  "If you put it off, I will inform against
you!"
</p>

<p>
"But we are thinking of you, Merira," Ay said.
"You are ill, you ought to look after yourself...."
</p>

<p>
"Here is my medicine!" Merira cried, pointing
to the poison ring that glittered on his finger.  "It
shall be as we decided: all will be over in three days'
time!"
</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">
Do not judge me, O Lord, for my
many sins!  I am a man with no
understanding of myself," Merira
whispered.
</p>

<p>
"What are you whispering?" Dio asked.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing."
</p>

<p>
He stood at the prow of the boat with a double-edged
harpoon in his hands and she sat at the helm,
rowing with a short oar, or pushing off in shallow
places with a long pole.  The flat-bottomed boat for
two, made of long stems of papyrus, tied together
and covered with coal tar, was so unstable that one
could hardly move in it without risk of upsetting it.
Merira wore the ancient hunting dress: a two-lobed
apron&mdash;<i>shenti</i> of white linen, a broad necklace
of turquoise and carnelian beads, a small beard
of black horsehair and a 'tiled' closely curled wig; all
the rest of the body was naked.  In such dress the
dead, after the resurrection, hunted in the blessed
fields of Ialu in the papyrus thickets of the heavenly
Nile.
</p>

<p>
The milky-white sky of the early morning was
changing to blue, as innocent as the smile of a child
asleep.  The waters of the Nile were still as a pond;
the morning breath was so gentle that the mirror-like
surface of the river was not yet broken with
ripples, though boats with full sails were already
flitting upon it like birds.  The rafts of pines and
cedars from Lebanon slowly floated along.  Men,
tiny as ants, dragged by a rope a huge barge with
a granite obelisk, singing a mournful song; it made
the stillness seem more still and the expanse of the
river more limitless.  The white houses of the City
of the Sun, scattered about like dice in the narrow
green strip of palm groves, were disappearing in
the distance.
</p>

<p>
"What is the matter with you?" Dio asked Merira.
"Happy? in good spirits?  No, that's not it....  I
have never seen you like this."
</p>

<p>
"I had a good night," Merira answered.  "I slept
for quite six hours on end."
</p>

<p>
He took a deep, eager breath.  He was glad when
he felt the smell of bats and not of dead rats or
rotten fish; and to-day&mdash;what joy! he smelt nothing
but morning freshness.
</p>

<p>
"And everything is good," he said, still more joyfully.
"See how high the water is!  Isn't it fine?"
</p>

<p>
"Very fine," she agreed.
</p>

<p>
"Just think, sixteen and a half cubits!  The water
hasn't risen so high for the last ten years!" Merira
went on.  "The country is saved if the rebels in the
south do not destroy the canals.  Look, a little ass
in the field doesn't dare to put its foot in the
ditch&mdash;ah, now he has done it, clever creature&mdash;and men
are more stupid than asses!"
</p>

<p>
He added, after a pause:
</p>

<p>
"I had a good dream the other night...."
</p>

<p>
"What was it?"
</p>

<p>
"It was about you.  I dreamt we were children
together walking in a lovely garden, better than
Maru-Aton&mdash;a real paradise&mdash;and you were saying
something very nice to me.  I woke up and thought
'I will do what she told me.'"
</p>

<p>
"And what did I say?"
</p>

<p>
He shook his head and said nothing.
</p>

<p>
"Again something you can't tell?"
</p>

<p>
"No."
</p>

<p>
He turned away to hide from her the tears that
came into his eyes:
</p>

<p>
"Don't judge me, O Lord, for my many sins!  I
am a man with no understanding of myself," he
whispered again.
</p>

<p>
He suddenly struck the water with his harpoon so
violently that he nearly upset the boat.  Dio cried
out.  When he pulled the harpoon out of the water
a fish was struggling on each side of it: an <i>in</i>, with
a rectangular, wing-like fin on its back, glittering
like ruby, sapphire and gold, and a <i>ha</i> with the
monstrous head of an anteater, consecrated to the god
Set.  He threw both fishes at her feet and she
admired the way they struggled, dying.
</p>

<p>
"Why do you say you have never seen me like
this?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know.  You always jeer, and to-day you
look as though you were going to smile.  Quite
like...."
</p>

<p>
"Like whom?"
</p>

<p>
She stopped suddenly and looked down; she
wanted to say 'quite like Tamu,' but suddenly she
felt frightened and sorry&mdash;sorry for this one as for
the other.
</p>

<p>
"Also something you can't tell?" he asked, smiling.
</p>

<p>
"No, I can't."
</p>

<p>
"There, there, look!" he pointed to something that
lay on the sand-bank and seemed exactly like a
greenish-black, slimy log.
</p>

<p>
"What is it?"
</p>

<p>
"A crocodile.  It hid in the sand for the night and
now it has crawled out and will warm itself in the
sun; and at midday, when the north wind blows, it
will open its mouth towards it to get cool.  An
intelligent beast.  But an ibis's feather paralyzes it
and then one can do anything with it..."
</p>

<p>
He spoke about indifferent things on purpose to
hide his emotion, but went on smiling exactly like
Tamu.
</p>

<p>
The boat cut into a dense mass of papyrus plants.
Their umbrella-like tops quivered as though alive,
the stems rustled and bent over the boat like two
high green walls.  The yellow ambaki flowers smelt
of bitter almond and warm water and the pink
lotoses, <i>nekhebs</i>, of sweet aniseed.  Blue dragonflies
whirred unceasingly over the floating leaves.  An
ichneumon, a sharp-faced little creature with whiskers,
something between a cat and a rat, was stealing
up the entangled papyrus-stems, and the bird-mother
fluttering over her nest desperately flapped her wings
to drive the robber away.  Suddenly in the far distance
there was a loud trumpet-call: it was a hippopotamus,
roaring as it spouted water from its nostrils
like a whale.
</p>

<p>
Water birds flew about in clouds: sacred
herons&mdash;<i>benu</i>&mdash;with two long feathers thrown back over
their heads, sacred ibises, bald-headed and white but
for a black tail and a black edge on the wings; wild
ducks, geese, swans, cranes, spoonbills, plovers,
water-hens, hoopoos, peewits, divers, pelicans,
cormorants, golden-eyes, lapwings, magpies, snipe,
fish-hawks and many others.  They were singing,
twittering, chirruping, calling, quacking, screeching,
whistling, cackling, cawing, droning, clucking.
</p>

<p>
"Vepvet!" Merira called, and a huge yellow hunting
cat, with emerald eyes, that had been sleeping at
the bottom of the boat, jumped to him and settled
beside him on the bow, pricking up its ears.
</p>

<p>
He threw a flat, curved tablet made of rhinoceros
skin&mdash;a weapon of immemorial antiquity.  It flew
along, struck its aim and describing an arc in the
air returned to him and fell at his feet.  The cat
jumped into the thicket and brought a bird that had
been killed.  He threw the weapon again, and the
cat brought another bird, and soon the boat was so
full of game that it began to sink.
</p>

<p>
They rowed to a little island surrounded on all
sides with thick walls of papyrus, three times the
height of man, bright green and fresh as in paradise.
In days of old, Mother Isis brought up the baby
Horus in such a papyrus nest.
</p>

<p>
They landed.  A fisherman's net was stretched out
on poles on the shore to dry.  There was a bed of
reeds under a shelter of dry palm leaves.  Dio sat on
the bed and Merira on the ground at her feet.  The
cat ate fish greedily.
</p>

<p>
"She is as good at scenting prey as Ruru was,"
Merira said.
</p>

<p>
"Why 'was'?" Dio asked in surprise.
</p>

<p>
"Don't you know?  The poor creature was killed
the other day.  Tuta wept over it as though it had
been his own daughter and has fallen ill with grief."
</p>

<p>
"Who killed it?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know.  It was found dead in the garden.
Someone must have climbed a tree and been listening
at the window, and the cat smelt him out and
rushed at him and he ripped its belly with a knife."
</p>

<p>
"But who could it have been?"
</p>

<p>
"Probably some spy of Mahu's."
</p>

<p>
"Impossible.  Mahu knows that Tuta is a faithful
servant of the king.  Why should he be watched?
</p>

<p>
"He might well be.  All we do at court is to watch
one another."
</p>

<p>
"And you watch me?"
</p>

<p>
"I do.  Do you remember how you spoke about
me with the king in the desert?  I know
everything&mdash;I know that you betray me."
</p>

<p>
He gave her a long, intent look.
</p>

<p>
"No, Merira," she said quietly.  "It is not I who
betray you&mdash;you do it yourself.  You deceive
yourself: you want to hate him and you cannot&mdash;you
love him...."
</p>

<p>
"I don't know.  Perhaps I do love him.  But love,
too, is sometimes cruel&mdash;more cruel than hate.  It is
said 'love is strong as death; jealousy is cruel as the
grave: the coals thereof are coals of fire; many
waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods
drown it.'  Do you know this?"
</p>

<p>
"I do.  Is this how you love me, too?"
</p>

<p>
"What is my love to you?  Why do you ask?  Do
you want to deceive me?"
</p>

<p>
"No.  Even if I wanted to I could not: we know
all about each other."
</p>

<p>
"Do we?  There is no getting to the bottom of
the soul&mdash;it is too deep."
</p>

<p>
"At the bottom of the soul is love; one who loves
knows everything.  Are you very unhappy?"
</p>

<p>
"And are you very sorry for me?  It is a bad
sign: if a woman pities a man she doesn't love him."
</p>

<p>
There was a silence.  Then he spoke again in a
changed voice, without looking at her.
</p>

<p>
"I have had another dream about you, a bad one.
Only I don't know if it was a dream.  Perhaps you
know what it was&mdash;a dream or not?"
</p>

<p>
She lowered her eyes, feeling that he was looking
at her: it was like spiders running over her naked
body; she was ashamed and frightened as in that
dream.
</p>

<p>
"No, Dio, I do not love you.  To love a woman one
must despise her just a little.  I might love you
when you are asleep or dead&mdash;as you were in that
dream.  You said then 'it is sweet to be weak, sweet
to be only a woman.'  But you wouldn't say that
awake, would you?  Why do you lie then?  You are
a woman after all: moths nest in clothes and slyness
in woman.  If you had only said to me then 'go
away' I would have gone.  And I will go now&mdash;you
have only to tell me...."
</p>

<p>
She put both her hands on his shoulders and said
simply and quietly:
</p>

<p>
"Listen, my brother, three people have already
perished through me; I don't want you to perish
too...."
</p>

<p>
"It wouldn't be through you, don't be afraid; I
hated him before you came."
</p>

<p>
There was a long silence, then she asked, speaking
still lower than before:
</p>

<p>
"What do you hate him for?"
</p>

<p>
"Don't you know?  Surely you don't believe, do
you, that King Akhnaton is the One who is to come?
</p>

<p>
"No.  I know he is only His shadow."
</p>

<p>
"But he does believe it himself."
</p>

<p>
"No, he doesn't.  That was your temptation, your
snare, but he is free from it now."
</p>

<p>
"He is not&mdash;he never will be.  I tempted him, you
say?  Why, could I ever have done it without him?
I merely said aloud what he thought; I revealed his
own secret to him.  And do you imagine one can say
'I am He' and then repent?  I don't know who has
been led into temptation&mdash;I by him or he by me.
But anyway, there is no greater temptation upon
earth than for a man to say 'I am God.'  Yes, he is
only a shadow of the One to come; this one has
said 'I will kindle the flame' and that One will kindle
it.  But maybe we still have time to put it out...."
</p>

<p>
"No, you will not put it out.  His fire is love!
'Many waters cannot quench love'&mdash;you have said
so yourself.  No, Merira, you will not rise against
him!"
</p>

<p>
"Do you think I am afraid of him?"
</p>

<p>
"Not of him but of the One behind him."
</p>

<p>
"Liar, Murderer, Devil is behind him.  If He came
I would rise against Him, too!"
</p>

<p>
The green walls parted suddenly and the king's
boat appeared.  The king stood at the stern with
Mahu and was saying something to him, pointing to
the island.
</p>

<p>
"He is looking, he is looking at us!" Merira
whispered in terror.  "Let us hide!"
</p>

<p>
They both went into the papyrus thicket.  The
boat passed them.
</p>

<p>
"I believe you are right after all, Dio, and I will
never rise against him," Merira said, with a quiet
laugh, passing his hand over his eyes as though he
had just awoken from a fearful dream.  "I may
rise against myself, but not against him...."
</p>

<p>
And after a silence he asked:
</p>

<p>
"You won't tell him what we have been talking
about, will you?"
</p>

<p>
"No, I won't," she replied and glancing at him
understood more clearly than she had ever done
before:
</p>

<p>
"He is an enemy."
</p>

<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-s.png" width="129" height="128" alt="S">
</div>

<p class="dropcap">
Saakera was giving a feast.  The
pillared hall of the palace where
the guests were assembled gave
on to an open porch and the porch
on to the river.  The palm-shaped
columns, decorated with a scaly
design of coloured glass on a golden background,
seemed made of precious stones, glittering in the
light of candelabra, each of which resembled a
burning bush; the yawning abyss of darkness gaped in
between.  There the rusty sickle of the waning moon
shed its dim light on the ragged tops of the Lybian
mountains and was reflected as a pillar of dull copper
in the black rippled surface of the river, so wide that
it was hard to believe it was a river and not the sea.
</p>

<p>
The night was still, but fresh, as often happens
during the overflow.  The gentle breeze from the
north blew so evenly that the flames of the lamps
were all bent to one side.
</p>

<p>
The blue ceiling, studded with golden stars, looked
through the white smoke of incense like a real sky
through the clouds.
</p>

<p>
The guests sat in a semi-circle in the square space
that was free from columns: the king was in the
middle, on his right sat Saakera, the heir-apparent,
with his consort, Meritatona, the king's eldest
daughter; then Ramose, Tuta, Ay; on the king's left
was the queen, next to her was an empty seat
reserved for Merira, who had not yet arrived; then
came Mahu, Dio, and others.  Members of the royal
family and senior dignitaries sat in arm-chairs and
on folding chairs, and the lesser ones sat on carpets
and mats on the floor.
</p>

<p>
Within the semi-circle stood a big, round, one-legged
table of alabaster.  It was covered with loaves
of bread shaped like pyramids, cones, balls and sacred
animals, dishes of food, covered with fresh leaves
to protect the food from flies, and mounds of fruit:
gigantic bunches of Lybian grapes, a foot long, the
rare fruits of shakarab, spotted like a leopard's skin,
and the egg-shaped persae in a four-petalled chalice,
golden-coloured and fragrant as flowers.  Four wine
and beer stands made of trellised woodwork and
garlanded with flowers stood round the table.
</p>

<p>
Nubian girls, dressed in white, transparent
linen&mdash;'woven air'&mdash;or naked but for a narrow girdle
just above the navel, served round the cups with
food and drink.  Meat was cut up into small pieces
and eaten with the fingers, which were washed in
scented water after every dish.  Wine and beer were
sucked through reeds.
</p>

<p>
Fans of ostrich feathers and flykillers of jackals'
tails were being waved unceasingly to keep off the
night midges, <i>zezet</i>.
</p>

<p>
Each guest wore on his head a tiny cup filled with
fragrant ointment, with a lotos stuck through it, so
that the flower hung over the forehead.  Melting
slowly with the warmth of the body and the heat of
the room the ointment fell in drops upon the white
linen of the dresses, leaving greasy yellow streaks
upon it; the greater the number of such streaks the
better: it meant the guest had been well looked after.
When the cup was empty the girls produced a new
one offering the choice between <i>kemi</i>, 'the royal
ointment,' or <i>anti</i>, 'the dew of the gods,' which gave a
golden tint to the skin and made the face look 'like
the morning star.'
</p>

<p>
"Where is Merira?" the king asked.
</p>

<p>
"He has promised to come, but he is not here yet.
He is not well.  He can't sleep," answered Saakera,
the heir apparent, a young man with a beautiful face,
fine and mournful like the sickle of the moon
turning pale in the morning sky.
</p>

<p>
"Why don't you cure him, Pentu?" the king asked.
</p>

<p>
"There is only one certain remedy against
sleeplessness, sire," Pentu, the physician, answered.
</p>

<p>
"What is it?"
</p>

<p>
"A clear conscience."
</p>

<p>
"But isn't his conscience clear?"
</p>

<p>
Pentu made no answer, as though he had not
heard, and there was a general silence.
</p>

<p>
"Why are you eating so little, Tuta?" the host
inquired solicitously.  "This is your favourite dish,
antelope from the salty plains.  Isn't it cooked to
your liking?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes, prince, it is excellent; I have eaten
much of it."
</p>

<p>
"He is telling fibs&mdash;he hasn't had a bite, I have
seen myself," the king laughed.  "He is grieving over
poor Ruru.  Haven't they discovered yet who killed
it?"
</p>

<p>
"No, they haven't," Tuta answered in confusion.
</p>

<p>
"They will soon discover it, I am on the track,"
Mahu said, looking intently at Tuta.
</p>

<p>
Tuta was more dead than alive: he took a piece
of meat into his mouth and could not swallow it.
</p>

<p>
"What's the matter with you, stomach-ache
again?" his consort, princess Ankhsenbatona, who sat
next to him, asked him in a whisper.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," he answered with the languid air he always
assumed when speaking about his health.
</p>

<p>
Ankhi knew that his stomach-ache was generally
due to fear.
</p>

<p>
"What has frightened you?"
</p>

<p>
He said nothing.
</p>

<p>
"Speak! what is it?  Ah, you insufferable creature!"
she whispered furiously and pinched his back
so viciously that he nearly cried out.
</p>

<p>
Ay saw Tuta's confusion and wanted to help him,
but did not know how.
</p>

<p>
Ay's wife, the great royal nurse, Ty, was sitting
next to him.  Enormously stout&mdash;a regular toad&mdash;with
a purplish face covered with warts that had
red hair on them, the old lady was wearing a fiery-red
wig, a Canaan novelty, and gold-coloured gloves,
a Hittite novelty; though there was no need to wear
them in a hot country like Egypt, she showed them
off on every festive occasion.  People thought her
half-mad, but she was very cunning and intelligent,
and a malicious gossip, especially in love affairs.
</p>

<p>
Soft-boiled ibis eggs were served.  They were not
eaten as a rule, for the ibis was a bird sacred to the
god Tot.  But this time all the company ate some to
please the king and show their contempt for the
false god.
</p>

<p>
Ty helped herself to three eggs.  It was awkward
to eat them with gloved hands and she smeared
herself with the yolk which, however, was not very
noticeable beside the yellow streaks from the
ointment.
</p>

<p>
"Aita!  Aita!" she suddenly said in a loud voice,
when there was a silence and everyone was occupied
with the eggs, and she gave a high-pitched little
laugh, curiously out of keeping with her enormous
size; it was like the silvery trill of a toad.
</p>

<p>
Ay looked at her and understood what he had to
do.  He began telling about the pretty Aita, wife
of one of the king's dignitaries who used to deceive
her husband so boldly and cleverly under his very
nose that everyone knew it except him.
</p>

<p>
"She had a feed, wiped her mouth and said 'I
haven't done any wrong'," Ay concluded.
</p>

<p>
"What?  What?" the king laughed.  "She had a
feed, wiped her mouth...." he tried to repeat it
but could not go on for laughter.
</p>

<p>
"Wiped her mouth and said 'I haven't done any
wrong'," Ay repeated.
</p>

<p>
"And what is your other saying?  'It is no use
crying....'" the king began again and could not
finish.
</p>

<p>
"No use crying over sour milk," Ay said.
</p>

<p>
Tuta was saved.  Ruru was forgotten.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile Dio was whispering with Mahu, the
chief of the guards.
</p>

<p>
"And what if he does not come?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"He is sure to come," Mahu answered.  "How
many have you hidden away?"
</p>

<p>
"Three hundred."
</p>

<p>
"That will do."
</p>

<p>
"Hadn't we better tell the king?"
</p>

<p>
"Heaven forbid!  If he learns it, all is lost, he will
not believe a word of it.  We must catch the scoundrel
red-handed....  Ah, there he is!"
</p>

<p>
Merira came in.  Tuta almost fainted.
</p>

<p>
"Here he is, at last!" said the king, getting up to
greet Merira.
</p>

<p>
He made him sit down next to the queen and
began asking him about his health.  Merira answered
calmly, almost jokingly.  But when a Nubian brought
him a cup of perfume he sent her away with a
grimace of disgust.
</p>

<p>
The little girls who sang and played the lute, the
tambourine, the flute and the cithern sat down in
a circle on the floor.  Miruit, Pentaur's pupil whom
Dio had brought with her from Thebes, stood in the
middle.  Her dark amber-coloured body could be
seen through the flowing folds of the transparent
dress.  Her face, ugly, charming and dangerous,
like the head of a snake, seemed tiny under the mass
of the dull black hair powdered with blue.
</p>

<p>
The girls played and sang:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Sweet one, you are sweet for love<br>
  Fairer than any woman,<br>
  Fairer than any girl,<br>
  Your hair is blacker than abed berries,<br>
  Your teeth are whiter than sunny flint.<br>
  Your lips are the bud of a flower,<br>
  Your arms are slender branches.<br>
  Two flowering crowns,<br>
  Your breasts are hardly formed,<br>
  Your nipples smell of myrrh."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Miruit was dancing the <i>dance de venire</i>.  The
upper part of the body remained motionless and the
lower moved rapidly, although she stood on the same
spot.  Her head was thrown back, her lips open, her
eyes dark and fixed, and the slender waist moved
like a serpent's tongue; the belly rose and fell, the
narrow, childish hips moved slower and slower as
though prolonging the last tremours of passion.  If
she had really done before everyone the things her
dance pictured, it would not have been so innocently
shameless.
</p>

<p>
The women looked down, the men smiled, beating
measure with their hands and the girls sang:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "You have captured my heart,<br>
  You have captured my heart<br>
  By a single look of your eyes.<br>
  How tender are your embraces,<br>
  How sweet your caresses!<br>
  Better than wine is your kiss,<br>
  The odour of your sweet body<br>
  Is better than any perfume."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
When Miruit had finished the dance the choir of
the blind men who had sung at the Sun's festival
entered the hall.  They sat down on the floor and
sang to the sounds of the harp:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "One generation replaces another,<br>
  The sun rises, the sun sets again,<br>
  The nostrils of all breathe the morning air,<br>
  Until man goes to his place of rest.<br>
  No one can return from there, no one can tell<br>
  What awaits us beyond the tomb.<br>
  Rejoice then, O mortal, in thy day of life,<br>
  Until the day of weeping comes.<br>
  I have heard of what befell my forefathers:<br>
  The walls of their tombs are destroyed,<br>
  Their coffins are empty like coffins of beggars,<br>
  Forsaken by everyone on earth.<br>
  Their dwelling place knows them no more.<br>
  It is as though they had never been:<br>
  Rejoice then, mortal, in thy day of life!<br>
  Oil thy body with fragrant oil<br>
  Make lotos garlands for thy arms<br>
  And the breasts of thy sister beloved.<br>
  Enjoy the music and the songs<br>
  Forget thou all thy sorrows,<br>
  Remember nothing but the joy,<br>
  Until the day thy boat shall land<br>
  Upon the shores of Silence."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The song stopped and the breath of the night blew
fresher than before from the black gaps between the
pillars; the flames of the lamps bent lower, all on
one side, as though someone invisible had come into
the room.
</p>

<p>
"Isn't it a fine song?" Saakera asked.
</p>

<p>
"No, prince, it isn't," answered Panehesy, the
second priest of Aton and the head of the king's
spies&mdash;a man without age who looked like a eunuch.
He was a mild fanatic, 'a holy fool,' in the words of
Ay.
</p>

<p>
"What's wrong with it?"
</p>

<p>
"It's godless.  If it is true, our faith is in vain."
</p>

<p>
"I would answer you, my friend, but it doesn't
behove ignorant men to speak in the presence of
the wise."
</p>

<p>
"Speak, Saakera," the king said.  "I like listening
to you.  You say what many people think, but don't
say, and to me even a bitter truth is dearer than a
sweet lie."
</p>

<p>
"Listen then, Panehesy," Saakera began.  "Let
the son of the Sun who has come down from heaven
speak of heavenly things, and I will speak of the
earthly.  We are all creatures of yesterday and we
know nothing, for our days upon earth are like a
shadow.  The same fate befalls the righteous and the
unrighteous, the good and the wicked, the clean and
the unclean, him that sacrifices and him that does
not sacrifice.  A man has no pre-eminence above a
beast: all are of the dust and all turn to dust again.
I have seen all the works that are done under the
sun and believe the dead are happier than the living,
and happiest of all is he who was never born!"
</p>

<p>
"What are we to do then, we who have been
born?" Panehesy asked.
</p>

<p>
"The song gives an answer: rejoice in your day,
mortals, but remember that the peace of the god with
the unbeating heart is the better portion."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you very much, our kind host, you have
given us a treat!" Ay laughed.  "Why, I couldn't
swallow a morsel to the accompaniment of a song
like that!"
</p>

<p>
"Why not, my friend?  Remembrance of sorrow
in the midst of joy is like salt in one's food."
</p>

<p>
"That's all very well, but every condiment should
be used in moderation, and this is too much salt."
</p>

<p>
"No, this is not salt," Pentu the physician said,
quietly, as though to himself.
</p>

<p>
"What is it then?" Ay asked.
</p>

<p>
"Poison," Pentu answered, quieter still.  Mahu
glanced at Merira.  He sat with his head bent and
his eyes half closed, his face as unmoved as that of
a man asleep or dead.
</p>

<p>
"Why don't you speak, sire?" Panehesy cried,
turning to the king.
</p>

<p>
"I don't speak because there is nothing to say: he
is right," the king answered.
</p>

<p>
"Well said, Abby darling!" Princess Meritatona
exclaimed, clapping her hands with delight.
</p>

<p>
Everyone looked at her with surprise.
</p>

<p>
"What does this mean, sire?" Panehesy faltered.
</p>

<p>
"It means, my friend, that if there is no God man
is worse off than a beast, because a beast does not
know its end and a man does."
</p>

<p>
"But there is God."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, there is.  Everyone says there is, but acts
as though there were not.  And haven't you read,
my son, that we shall have to give a terrible answer
for empty words?  Pentu, too, is right: there is
poison in that song.  But poison may be a medicine.
There are two endings to the song: one is 'eat, drink
and die' and another 'feed the starving, give drink to
the thirsty'....  But it is better not to speak of it.
God is a spring in the wilderness, sealed for the
talkers and open for the silent.  Merira is silent and
he is right, more right than any of us.  Don't be
vexed with our chatter, our silent friend, forgive us!"
</p>

<p>
Merira made no answer, he merely looked at the
king and his face remained as unmoved as though
he were asleep or dead.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly there came through the stillness the
slow, measured clang of the cymbals on the roof of
Aton's temple, as though a huge heart of brass began
beating in the night.
</p>

<p>
All rose from their seats; the king, the queen, the
princesses, the heir-apparent and Merira walked to
the altar that stood in the depths of the room before
a bas-relief of the god Aton.
</p>

<p>
"Glory be to the unseen god, to the midnight
sun!" Merira intoned.  "Oh, mighty Falcon, with
broad wings, flying through the two skies, hastening
in thy sleepless course through the sky underneath
the earth, to arise in thy place in the morning, the
most secret of secret gods.  In thy life the dead come
to life again; thou givest their nostrils the breath of
life and air to their stifled throats.  Thou bringest
light to those who are in death; glorifying thee from
within their tombs, the dead lift up their hands and
those in the earth rejoice!"
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
When the cymbals sounded Mahu and Dio went
into the adjoining room.  He walked up to the wall,
knocked at it gently and put his ear to it.  A knock
came from the other side, too.  The block of stone
in the wall turned round like a swing door, leaving
a narrow opening.  The palace walls were double
and there was a hiding place between them.  No one
knew of it except the king, Mahu and Ramose.
</p>

<p>
The Hittite Amazons of the king's bodyguard
came out of the open door noiselessly like shadows.
The dwarf Iagu jumped out after them, ran up to
Mahu and asked in a whisper:
</p>

<p>
"Where are they?"
</p>

<p>
"Who?"
</p>

<p>
"Tuta, Merira."
</p>

<p>
"Why do you want to know?"
</p>

<p>
"I won't give them to anyone, I will throttle them
with my own hands."
</p>

<p>
It was Iagu who had killed Ruru: he had climbed
the tree by the window, looked into the room, listened
to all that the conspirators said and told Mahu.
</p>

<p>
"You are a fine fellow, Iagu!" said Mahu, patting
the dwarf on the head.  "Tiny as you are, you have
a lion's heart.  But there's one thing, my friend: if
you want to save the king, you must not touch them,
do you hear?"
</p>

<p>
"I hear," Iagu answered, grinding his teeth.
</p>

<p>
"Make haste, make haste!" Dio hurried them.
</p>

<p>
"Don't be afraid, we'll be in time," Mahu said
calmly.  "You go to the king, and I will wait here.
We will run out as soon as you call."
</p>

<p>
Dio returned to the guest chamber.  Both Tuta
and Ay had gone.  The king stood by the altar,
whispering a prayer.  Dio placed herself behind him,
opposite Merira.
</p>

<p>
A table with bread, wine and fruit stood near the
altar.  Merira went to it and began preparing the
libation cup.
</p>

<p>
He then returned to the altar, holding the cup
in his hands.
</p>

<p>
Dio noticed a ring with a carbuncle on his finger;
he had not worn it before.
</p>

<p>
Their eyes met.  "Who is to drink the cup?" he
read the question in her eyes.  "You will see," she
read the answer in his.
</p>

<p>
He approached the king and said:
</p>

<p>
"King Uaenra, Sun's only Son, light of light, spirit
of spirit, flesh of Sun's flesh, accept the cup of life,
drink the cup of immortality, thou who overcomest
death!"
</p>

<p>
He held out the cup to the king.  But before
Akhnaton had had time to take it, Dio snatched it
out of Merira's hand and threw it on the floor.
</p>

<p>
"What are you doing?" the king cried.
</p>

<p>
"I've poured out the poison," Dio answered and
she called:
</p>

<p>
"Mahu!  Mahu!"
</p>

<p>
The door was flung open, and the Hittite women,
led by Mahu, ran into the room.  Some surrounded
the king, others occupied the porch and mounted
guard by the doors, but most of them ran to the next
room where a battle with a detachment of Midian
mercenaries had started.
</p>

<p>
"Rebellion!  Save the king!" the dignitaries cried,
rushing about the room in search of an exit.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly there was a loud hammering at the door
from which the Hittite women had come.  Both
halves of the door were creaking and shaking under
the blows of the axe from the other side.  No one
had expected an attack from the rear.  The Amazons
had barely had time to run to the door.  A new battle
began there.
</p>

<p>
Arrows and spears whistled in the air.  A spear
struck the stand with wines, and it fell with a clatter
of broken crockery.  A candelabrum was overthrown
and the mats on the floor caught fire.
</p>

<p>
"Fire!  Fire!" the dignitaries shouted, but they
did nothing to put it out.
</p>

<p>
A Nubian girl seized a carpet and flung it over
the flame, extinguishing it at once.
</p>

<p>
An arrow pierced the fragrant cup on Ty's head
and tore off the wig, leaving her bald head bare.
But the old woman sat unperturbed and did not even
take her gloves off; rebellion seemed to be part of
the court ceremonial to her.
</p>

<p>
Miruit, wounded in the stomach with a spear, lay
in a pool of blood on the floor, scratching the ground
with her nails and showing her teeth as it were in
a smile, and the narrow childish hips moved slower
and slower as though ending the dance of love.
</p>

<p>
The Hittite Amazons might not have withstood
the attack of the Midians, had not half the mercenaries
deserted the conspirators at the last moment.
</p>

<p>
The noise of the battle began to subside, the rebels
were in retreat.  The women had conquered the men.
It had all happened so quickly that those present had
hardly come to their senses.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly Ramose, lightly wounded in the left
arm, came into the chamber dragging Tuta after
him.  He threw him at the king's feet and cried:
</p>

<p>
"Here is the chief criminal, sire!  It is for his sake
the other one has been working," he pointed to
Merira and turned to Tuta again.  "Confess, you
rascal, or I'll kill you like a dog."
</p>

<p>
He raised the knife over Tuta.  The king seized
his hand.
</p>

<p>
"Let go the knife!"
</p>

<p>
Ramose did not obey and, shaking with anger,
grumbled:
</p>

<p>
"Will you forgive this one, too?"
</p>

<p>
"It's for me to decide what I will do, but you let
go the knife!"
</p>

<p>
The king pulled the knife out of Ramose's hand
by force and threw it aside.
</p>

<p>
"Woe to us!  God will not save him who ruins
himself!" the old man muttered, sinking into an
armchair heavily, exhausted by his wound.
</p>

<p>
Tuta lay at the king's feet.
</p>

<p>
"Is it true that you have done it?" the king asked
him.
</p>

<p>
"Not I, not I, sire, God sees it isn't I...." Tuta
babbled, pointing his finger at Merira.
</p>

<p>
Merira stood at a distance without moving; he
looked so unconcerned that he seemed not to see or
hear anything.  Someone had tied his hands behind
his back.
</p>

<p>
The king went up to him and asked:
</p>

<p>
"You wanted to kill me, Merira?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"Why?"
</p>

<p>
"Because you prepare the way for the Son of
perdition."
</p>

<p>
"Haven't we prepared it together?"
</p>

<p>
"No, not together."
</p>

<p>
"Why have you lied to me, then?"
</p>

<p>
"To destroy your work."
</p>

<p>
"But why did you rise against Him?"
</p>

<p>
"May I ask you a favour, sire?"
</p>

<p>
"Do."
</p>

<p>
"Don't ask me about anything and put me to
death as soon as possible."
</p>

<p>
"No, Merira, I will not put you to death."
</p>

<p>
"You will forgive me like Tuta?" Merira said,
with a smile that looked like a grimace of disgust.
He had spoken with his eyes on the ground; suddenly
he raised them and said looking straight into the
king's eyes:
</p>

<p>
"Do what you like, but remember, Uaenra, that if
you don't kill me, I will...."
</p>

<p>
He did not finish, but the king understood 'I will
kill you.'
</p>

<p>
He put both hands on Merira's shoulders, and,
also looking straight into his eyes, said, with a gentle
smile:
</p>

<p>
"Remember, you too, Merira: whatever happens,
I love you."
</p>

<p class="dropcap">
The king was the last to learn that
Princess Makitatona was with child.
She confessed it to him herself, but
did not say who the man was and
so implored him not to ask her that
he had pity and reassured her:
</p>

<p>
"Don't tell me if you don't want to; you will
tell me when you feel that you can."
</p>

<p>
He blamed himself for everything: "If I loved
her more, this would not have happened!"  He was
doing himself injustice: he loved all his daughters
and Maki more than the rest.
</p>

<p>
He thought the queen knew, but she did not.  The
princess's nurse, old Asa, may have suspected
something, but she would rather have had her tongue cut
off than said anything.
</p>

<p>
There were strange rumours in the town: it was
said that the princess had been seduced by a tramp,
a runaway slave or, perhaps, by the Jew Iserker
himself; it would not have been very difficult, because
the king's daughters were not properly looked after;
Princess Makitatona had been seen to go out alone
into the desert through the secret gate in the
Maru-Aton garden wall.  And people added, not without
malice, that the Jews were highly delighted, for they
thought that the princess would give birth to their
Messiah.
</p>

<p>
The dwarf, Lagu, was brought one day to the
palace half dead: he had had a fight with a crowd of
street ruffians who were gazing at a charcoal
drawing of the princesses made on the wall with an
indecent inscription beneath it.
</p>

<p>
The king allowed Maki to live in retirement in
the Maru-Aton palace until her confinement.  She
spent the days there in a perfectly dark room with
the shutters closed and the windows curtained: she
could not bear the light.  She had had attacks of
this disease before: daylight seemed to stab not only
her eyes, but her whole body as with a knife; if
a ray of sunshine penetrated into the room, she cried
and groaned as with intolerable pain.
</p>

<p>
The eldest princess, Meritatona, or Rita, Saakera's
wife, was inseparable from Maki.  There was a
year's difference between the sisters&mdash;one was
fifteen, the other fourteen; they loved each other
tenderly though they were as different as day and
night.
</p>

<p>
Maki had been betrothed to Saakera, who was
passionately in love with her; she loved him, too, but
renounced him for Rita's sake and made a vow of
virginity to the god Attis.  The god's chapel was in
the hilly desert not far from Maru-Aton.  The
droning of the eunuchs engaged in their devotions
sounded like jackals howling in the night.
</p>

<p>
Some ten days after Saakera's feast Maki and
Rita were sitting at Maru-Aton late one evening in
a long and narrow Water House, supported by palm-shaped
pillars with a labyrinth of eleven ornamental
pools.  Their slanting walls were covered with paintings
of water plants, lotoses and papyrus, that seemed
to be growing out of water; above them were painted
pomegranate bushes and clumps of vine.  Beds of
living flowers were all round.
</p>

<p>
Rita and Maki were reclining on pillows by the
water's edge, under bushes of white, pink, and red
roses.
</p>

<p>
"Why didn't you tell sooner, you silly?  We could
have arranged things, and now look at yourself: it
is too late," said Rita, feeling Maki's body as an
experienced midwife.  Pregnancy seemed monstrous
in a little creature like Maki, almost a child.
</p>

<p>
"Saakera's Ethiopian has some stuff.  Shall I ask
her?  Perhaps it could still be done...."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Rita, don't speak of it, please don't!"
</p>

<p>
"Very well, don't whine....  What was I talking
about?  Yes, about Ankhi.  She wants to run away
and join Tuta.  The rascals did not stay long in
prison&mdash;they escaped to Nut-Amon; I expect they'll
stir up a rising there.  No, I would not have let them
off: they ought to have been killed on the spot.  But
our courtiers are all traitors and scoundrels."
</p>

<p>
She spoke listlessly, evidently thinking of something
else.  Suddenly she smiled, as though recalling
something funny.
</p>

<p>
"Shiha is a clever man!  Do you know what he
says of Enra?"  Shiha was the high priest and
eunuch of the god Attis.
</p>

<p>
"What?" Maki asked.  She started slightly at the
name of Shiha and Rita noticed it.
</p>

<p>
"He says Enra lives as though all were well with
the world; but all is not well!"
</p>

<p>
"All is not well?" Maki repeated, frowning with
the childish effort to understand.
</p>

<p>
"Do you remember Yuma's death?" Rita went
on.  Yuma was a little black slave who died of a
tarantula sting.
</p>

<p>
"She turned greyish-white all over, just like an
autumn fly covered with mildew, and a smell of
corruption came from her before she died.  And
the day before yesterday someone had attacked a
little girl of five by the very walls of Aton's temple,
strangled her and thrown the body to the pigs.  Is
that well?  And Enra lives as though none of these
things happened.  Perhaps all is well for God, but
Enra is not God; people say he is, but he himself
knows he isn't."
</p>

<p>
She pondered for a while and began again:
</p>

<p>
"He does not know how to cry, but one cannot
live without tears; nothing is sweeter than tears..."
</p>

<p>
"Does Shiha say that?" Maki asked.
</p>

<p>
"No, I say it .... or perhaps Shiha, I don't
remember....  What is Aton, the Sun?  A spark in
darkness: death will blow and the sun will be
extinguished.  Darkness is more than light; first there
was darkness and then light.  Maybe God dwells in
darkness."
</p>

<p>
She laughed suddenly.
</p>

<p>
"You, too, are a sensible girl; you are afraid of
light and love darkness.  The daughter does not take
after the father."
</p>

<p>
Maki listened greedily; sometimes she strove to
say something, but words froze on her lips; she
merely looked at her sister with wide open eyes and
seemed like one bound hand and foot waiting for
a blow.
</p>

<p>
"Well, that's enough moping, let us go!  You
must walk about, it is good for you," Rita said,
lifting her with apparent roughness, but in reality
with tender care, and led her into the garden.
</p>

<p>
It was dusk.  The sky was clear, but mist was
creeping over the ground.  The water in the river
had only just returned to its normal level; there
were still pools of water about.  Drops fell from the
wet leaves.  Frogs croaked ecstatically.  The smell
of the flowers was intoxicating.  All at once the
mist turned rosy from the moon that was rising
invisibly.
</p>

<p>
They walked to the big pond where Maki's birch
tree grew.  It had never recovered after the scorching
Sheheb.  Everything round it was green and in
flower, but it was dead and only on some of the
bare branches a withered leaf showed black.
</p>

<p>
Maki put her arms round the pale, slender stem
and pressed her cheek against it.
</p>

<p>
"Poor, poor darling!" she whispered tenderly as
though saying good-bye to a friend who had died.
</p>

<p>
"A-ah, you remember the superstition!" Rita said,
with a laugh.  "If one plants a tree and it dies, the
person who planted it will die also.  Well, even if
you do die, that's nothing very dreadful&mdash;you will
have had a child anyway.  To think of God sending
such happiness to one who doesn't want it!  Why,
I would die ten times if I could only have a child."
</p>

<p>
After walking round the big pond, they came to
the Lotos pond, with Aton's chapel on a little island
and a small bridge leading to it.  A huge lotos, not
yet fully opened, showed white on the water.  A boat
was tied near by.  Rita jumped into it, and seeing
a garden knife at the bottom, took it to cut the
lotos; she gave the flower to Maki and hid the
knife in the bosom of her dress.
</p>

<p>
They went back to the Water-House and sat
down in the old place.
</p>

<p>
"You haven't been to see Shiha for some time,
have you?" Rita asked.
</p>

<p>
"No, I haven't."
</p>

<p>
"And I often go to him.  It is interesting.  A
regular abode of love.  All our dignitaries' wives keep
going there.  These eunuchs are excellent matchmakers.
And they are themselves fond of women&mdash;and
the women like it, of course.  Shiha tempts me,
too, with the god's marriage-bed: 'the god will come
down to you in the night like a bridegroom to his
bride,' he says.  But I am not a fool to buy a pig in
a poke.  Instead of a god a slave or a dirty Jew may
come and disgrace one..."
</p>

<p>
She paused and then spoke again, looking straight
into Maki's eyes:
</p>

<p>
"Extraordinary!  How is it possible not to find
out who the father of your child is?  Why, I would
get the wretch from the bottom of the sea!  But
Shiha knows who came to you then.  Would you like
me to threaten him so that he should tell? ... Well,
why are you silent?  Do you want me to?"
</p>

<p>
"Do what you like, but don't torment, don't
torment me so!  Better make an end of it."  Maki
moaned, pale and trembling as though she were on
the rack.
</p>

<p>
Rita drew back, and she trembled, too.
</p>

<p>
"Make an end of it?  Do you think I know everything
and merely tease you, play cat and mouse with
you?  Well, perhaps I do know....  What's the
matter, why are you so frightened?  Perhaps you
know, too?  A-ah, I've caught you!  Speak, tell me,
who is it?  He?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, he, Saakera," Maki answered, with apparent
calm, looking straight into her eyes.  "Well, kill me,
I don't care..."
</p>

<p>
Rita brought the knife out of her bosom and flung
it far away.  She buried her face in her hands and
sat for a few minutes without moving; then she
drew her hands away from her face and put them
on Maki's shoulders.
</p>

<p>
"There, it's a good thing you told me or very
likely I would have killed you, really.  Do you
remember Ankhi's doll?"
</p>

<p>
When Rita and Ankhi were little they had once
a fight over a clay doll, a hideous thing that they
both loved passionately.  Rita took it from her sister,
who pulled it out of her hands, and broke it into bits
against the wall.  Then Rita fell upon Ankhi like
a fury and bit her throat; the nurses had difficulty
in dragging her off.  And in the night she stole away
into the garden and ate some poison berries, 'spiders'
eggs'; she very nearly died.
</p>

<p>
"The devil entered into me then, and now, too.
We have all taken after father&mdash;we are possessed....
Yes, it is a good thing you told me.  All is
well now&mdash;it's over!  But I do wonder at myself: I
thought I would kill you if you told me; and now I
don't feel anything.  Silly girls had a fight over a
doll, but perhaps it was not worth while, after all.
You know what a number of wives Saakera has.
Sheep are in the stalls, fish in the hatchery and we in
his palace.  You and I are no better than the others.
You gave me your betrothed, I gave you my husband,
so we are quits and that's an end of it.  We'll
be friends as before, better than before.  When the
baby is born&mdash;it must be a boy, we don't want a
girl&mdash;we'll look after it together....  What's the
matter, why are you silent again?  Don't you believe me?"
</p>

<p>
"I do, but I am afraid...."
</p>

<p>
"What of?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know....  You may forgive me, but I
will torment myself to death....  Oh, Rita, darling,
why didn't you kill me straight away?  It would
have been better to make an end of it!"
</p>

<p>
"Nonsense!  All will be forgiven and forgotten if
only one lives and loves.  And you do love me,
don't you&mdash;more than before?"
</p>

<p>
"More, much more!  I love you dreadfully, that's
why I will die&mdash;because I love you so.  You know,
Rita, if one loves very much, one cannot live, it's too
great a joy...."
</p>

<p>
"It was after that you got to love me so?" Rita
asked, with slight mockery.
</p>

<p>
Instead of answering Maki hid her face on Rita's
breast and burst into tears.
</p>

<p>
"There, that will do," Rita said, drily.  "It is time
to go home&mdash;see what heavy dew there is."
</p>

<p>
She took her by the arms and again led her along
carefully like a nurse.
</p>

<p>
They went indoors.  Rita put her sister to bed and
sat down beside her, waiting for her to go to sleep.
</p>

<p>
"Don't go," Maki begged.
</p>

<p>
"I won't, don't be afraid, I'll sleep here beside
you."
</p>

<p>
"You do love me, yes?" Maki whispered in her ear.
</p>

<p>
"No, I don't love you a bit.  Why, you silly girl,
if I didn't love you, I wouldn't torment you
so.... there, that's enough talking, go to sleep."
</p>

<p>
"No, wait a minute, what was I going to say? ... Oh,
yes!  You know I do not know for certain who
came to me then.  I told you it was he, Saakera, but
I don't really know&mdash;perhaps it wasn't he."
</p>

<p>
"Who was it, then?"
</p>

<p>
"He Whom I was expecting.  I doubted, I did not
believe&mdash;and this is why I suffer now.  I shall die in
misery, but when I am dead, perhaps He will come
again."
</p>

<p>
"There, don't let us talk of it, sleep.  Shall I tell
you a story?"
</p>

<p>
"Do," Maki answered in a sleepy, childish voice.
</p>

<p>
"Once upon a time there lived a king and queen,"
Rita began the tale of the Bewitched Prince, in a
sing-song voice like the old nurse, Asa.  "One day
they prayed to the gods and the gods gave them a
son.  And when he was born the seven Hathor came
to decree his destiny and said, 'this man will meet
with death from a crocodile, a snake, or a dog.'  And
the king was very, very sorry when he heard of this.
And he caused a tower to be built in the mountains
and settled the prince there.  And the prince was
very, very happy there...."
</p>

<p>
She stopped, listened to her sister's even breathing
and kissing her on the eyes, that she might have
good dreams, went out of the room.
</p>

<p>
Old Asa, the princesses' nurse, could not go to
sleep in her stuffy room and went out into the
garden; seeing something white flit among the trees
she was frightened and wondered if it were Tiy&mdash;she
knew that the dead queen walked about at night.
But, recognizing Princess Meritatona, she called to
her.  The girl stopped, looked round without answering
and ran along, disappearing among the thick
bushes.
</p>

<p>
Used as Asa was to the princess's whims, she was
surprised and then frightened&mdash;in a different way
than at first: she felt there was something really
alarming about the white phantom.
</p>

<p>
She ran after Rita, but her old legs did not obey
her very well.  She went on and on, calling her
name, but there was no trace of her.
</p>

<p>
She met the gardener.
</p>

<p>
"Have you seen the princess?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I have."
</p>

<p>
"Where?"
</p>

<p>
"On the Lotos pond, in the chapel."
</p>

<p>
"What was she doing there?"
</p>

<p>
"I can't say."
</p>

<p>
"Let us go and look."
</p>

<p>
They walked to the chapel.  The gardener did not
dare to go in; Asa went in, but ran out immediately,
screaming wildly, and fell to the ground, almost
knocking the gardener off his feet.
</p>

<p>
He went into the chapel and saw the princess
hanging on the brass rod of the curtain before the
altar.  She had made the noose out of the curtain
drawstring but so badly that it slipped off.  Hanging
unevenly, her body rested with the toes of the left
foot on the corner of the bench she had knocked
down after climbing on to it to throw the string
over the rod.
</p>

<p>
When the gardener cut the string and took the
noose off Rita's neck she did not breathe and her
face was so blue and fixed that he thought her dead.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Maki dreamt that she was lying on the marriage-bed
in a high tower in the starry sky, waiting for
Him as she had done then, in the temple of Attis;
she knew that He would come and that His face
would be like the moon, the sun of the night, not
burning, not terrible, like the face of the god whose
name is Quiet Heart.
</p>

<p>
She woke up and called:
</p>

<p>
"Rita!"
</p>

<p>
She looked round&mdash;there was no one in the room;
only the moon looked in at the window, bright as
the sun of the night.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly far away in the garden cries were heard.
Maki jumped up, ran into the garden and listened.
The cries came nearer and nearer.  Men with torches
ran about shouting.
</p>

<p>
Maki ran towards the torches.  The men were
carrying something long and white.  Maki rushed
forward with a shriek.  The men made way for her.
Moonlight fell upon Rita's face, and Maki fell
fainting upon the ground.
</p>

<p>
Rita was in a deep swoon.  She was saved in the
end, but for several weeks she was at death's door
as in childhood when she had eaten 'spiders' eggs.'
</p>

<p>
The same night Maki's labour pains began and
by the morning she was safely delivered of a son.
</p>

<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-t.png" width="126" height="126" alt="T">
</div>

<p class="dropcap">
There was brilliant sunshine outside,
but it was dark as night in the
bedchamber of the Maru-Aton palace,
with the shutters closed and the
windows curtained; only the gilded
columns glimmered faintly in the
dim lamplight.
</p>

<p>
A bed of carved ebony and ivory, painted and
gilded, stood in the middle of the room on a platform
with four steps.  It was shaped like a fantastic
monster, a mixture of crocodile and hippopotamus,
with lion's feet and open jaws: it guarded the
sleeper; the more fearful the bed, the sweeter the
sleep.  Strangely convex, round and hard, with a
wooden crescent for a pillow, it seemed uncomfortable,
but was in truth better than any other bed, for
it was cool to sleep on in the hot nights when feather
beds and pillows were unendurable.
</p>

<p>
Princess Makitatona lay on the bed.  On the fourth
day after her delivery she had been attacked with
child-bed fever.
</p>

<p>
The dark, stuffy room smelt of drugs.  Pentu, the
physician, was pounding in a mortar of stone a
complicated remedy, composed of forty-six ingredients,
corresponding to the same number of blood vessels
in the human body.  In addition to medicinal herbs it
contained lizard's blood, sulphur from pigs' ears,
powder from the head and wings of the sacred beetle,
Kheper, a pregnant woman's milk, a hippopotamus's
tooth and flies' dirt.
</p>

<p>
In another corner of the room a Babylonian sorcerer,
Assursharatta, was boiling in a cauldron the
blood of a freshly slain lamb with magical herbs and
muttering a spell against the seven demons of fever:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Sibiti shunu, sibiti shunu,<br>
  Sibit adi shina shunu.<br>
  They are seven, they are seven,<br>
  They are seven twice over.<br>
  There are seven of them in heaven,<br>
  There are seven of them in hell.<br>
  They are neither male nor female,<br>
  They are childless and unmarried.<br>
  Whirlwinds that bring destruction<br>
  Do not know what mercy is,<br>
  Do not bend their ear to prayer.<br>
  They are evil, they are mighty,<br>
  They are seven, they are seven!<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
But nothing helped the patient&mdash;neither the medicines
nor the spells, nor even the healing water from
the well of the Sun in Heliopolis, where the god Ra
washed his face when he lived on earth.
</p>

<p>
In vain old Asa whispered the incantation:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Mother Isis cries<br>
  From the top of the hill:<br>
  "Horus my son,<br>
  The hill is on fire,<br>
  Bring me water,<br>
  Quench the fire."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The fire of the fever would not be quenched.
</p>

<p>
In vain the queen read over her daughter the
prayer of Mother Isis.  When a scorpion stung baby
Horus she cried to the sun and the sun was darkened,
night was upon the earth until the god Tot healed
the baby and gave it back to its mother.  Since then
the magical prayer of Isis had always been read over
sick children.
</p>

<p>
"Stand still, O Sun, stand still until the child is
restored to its mother!" the queen repeated with
frenzied entreaty, but she knew the miracle would
not happen, the sun would not stop.
</p>

<p>
She recalled the hymn to Aton:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Thou conquerest all through love,<br>
  Thou soothest the babe in the womb<br>
  Before its mother can soothe it.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
But now He failed to soothe her.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Thou hast mercy upon a worm<br>
  And upon the midges of the air.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
But now He had no mercy upon her.
</p>

<p>
The king and queen never left the invalid's side,
but she was delirious and did not recognize them.  If
a ray of sunlight penetrated between the curtains
or through a crack in the door, she grew restless
and cried:
</p>

<p>
"It is coming, it is coming again!  There it is
stretching out its leg....  Abby darling, do drive
it away, quick!  It will seize me and suck me dry like
a fly ... whoever could have let a spider into the
sky?"
</p>

<p>
The king understood: Aton the Sun was the
spider, the hand shaped rays were the spider's legs.
</p>

<p>
But most often she talked in her delirium about
Shiha, the eunuch.
</p>

<p>
"Shiha, what does it mean 'light is greater than
darkness'?  Who has blasphemed against divine
darkness?  Do you say King Uaenra is godless? .... How
dare you, you old monkey? .... Drink, drink!
Isn't there something cooler?  You gave me boiling
water last time, it scalded my mouth...."
</p>

<p>
They gave her the freshest water out of porous
Tyntyrian vessels, but she pushed the cup away:
</p>

<p>
"Hot water again!"
</p>

<p>
The baby boy had been born prematurely; it had
no nails, no hair and was weak and pale like a blade
of grass grown in darkness.  It hardly cried at all
and only wrinkled its face painfully at the lamplight.
</p>

<p>
"It isn't right for a baby to be in darkness: it may
go blind; it must be taken into the sunshine," the
midwives decided.
</p>

<p>
But as soon as they took it out into the light of
day it screamed and struggled as in a fit; they had
to take it back into the dark.  It was born an enemy
of Aton the Sun.
</p>

<p>
"Is it night outside?" Maki asked in one of her
lucid intervals.
</p>

<p>
"No, it is day," the king answered.
</p>

<p>
"The day of life is short, the night of death is
long," she said, with a quiet smile, looking into his
eyes, as it were into his very heart.  "Shiha says
'darkness was before light; sunshine is a veil over
darkness.'  Shall the dead see the sun?  What do you
think, Enra?"
</p>

<p>
He was about to answer, but she began to wander
again.
</p>

<p>
"A hen, a white hen with a red wig on like Ty's....
It is running after me....  Oh, it has stuck its
teeth into me!"
</p>

<p>
The king remembered that the white hen was the
mate of the cock with which he and the princesses
had played once.  Old Asa wept bitterly: she thought
the hen with teeth was a bad omen.
</p>

<p>
"Do explain, Shiha," Maki wandered, "King
Uaenra is wiser than all the sons of men: how is it
he does not know death?  He lives and sings to the
sun as though there were no death and all were well...
What will he sing when he does know death?"
</p>

<p>
Sometimes the king fancied it was not mere delirium:
it was as though she knew that he was there
without seeing him and spoke for his benefit, passed
dreadful judgment upon him, laughed at him with
a terrible laugh.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Enra, Enra, why don't you pray?" the queen
repeated like one insane, looking at him with dry,
tearless eyes.  "Pray!  Your prayer is strong: the
Father will hear His son.  Save her, Enra!"
</p>

<p>
The king was silent.  He felt so ashamed that he
could have screamed with shame, as with pain, but
worse than shame, pain and death was the mockery
"what will you sing when you do know death?"
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
At the same time princess Meritatona was lying
ill in the apartments of Saakera, the heir-apparent.
</p>

<p>
Maki kept talking of her as of one dead.
</p>

<p>
"All through me, through me!" she repeated in
anguish.
</p>

<p>
"But, darling, Rita is alive," her mother said,
trying to comfort her.  But she would not believe it.
</p>

<p>
"No, mother, don't deceive me, I saw how they
carried her, dead."
</p>

<p>
"She might be saved if only she believed me," the
queen thought.  "But how can I convince her?  And
what has happened between them?  A fine mother
I am&mdash;I don't know why one daughter strangled
herself and by whom the other has had a child....
Perhaps Enra knows?  He spoke with her then&mdash;he
must know."
</p>

<p>
She questioned the king when they were alone
together.
</p>

<p>
"Enra, do you know who the baby's father is?"
</p>

<p>
"No, I don't know."
</p>

<p>
"Haven't you asked her?"
</p>

<p>
"I have, but she did not say."
</p>

<p>
"How is it you didn't find out, how could you
have left her to face such torture alone?"
</p>

<p>
"I pitied her."
</p>

<p>
"And don't you pity her now?  Enra, Enra, what
have you done!"
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The baby did not live long: it died by the evening
of the fifth day as quietly as though it had gone to
sleep.
</p>

<p>
"Where is the boy?" Maki asked, coming to herself.
</p>

<p>
"It is asleep," the queen answered.
</p>

<p>
"Never mind, I'll be very careful, let me have
him!"
</p>

<p>
No one moved or spoke.
</p>

<p>
"Give him to me, do!" Maki repeated, looking
round at them all.  "Mother, where is he?  Tell me
the truth....  What has happened?  Is he dead?"
</p>

<p>
The queen covered her face with her hands.
</p>

<p>
"Well, perhaps it is better so," Maki said quietly.
"We shall soon be together...."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
That same night before dawn the death struggle
began.  She no longer tossed about or wandered;
she lay quite naked: the lightest covering oppressed
her; the slender, childish body seemed flat and
crushed as though it had been trodden on like a
blade of grass; the head with the elongated skull
was thrown back, the eyes closed, the face immovable
and the breathing so faint that at times it was
not noticeable.
</p>

<p>
Pentu, the physician, brought to her lips a round
brass mirror and when it grew slightly clouded, he
said:
</p>

<p>
"She breathes."
</p>

<p>
Suddenly she opened her eyes and called:
</p>

<p>
"Enra, where is Enra?"
</p>

<p>
"Here," the king answered bending over her, and
she whispered in his ear, like a blade of grass
rustling:
</p>

<p>
"Open the shutters."
</p>

<p>
He knew she was afraid of light and did not venture
to open all the shutters at once, but ordered them
to draw the curtains from one window only.
</p>

<p>
"All, all," she whispered.
</p>

<p>
All the windows were flung open.  The morning
sun flooded the room&mdash;the rays of the god Aton
like a child's hands embraced her naked body.
</p>

<p>
"Lift me up," the blade of grass rustled, and
the king lifted her as easily as though she were a
blade of grass.  The sun lighted her face.
</p>

<p>
"Akhnaton, Sun's joy, Sun's only Son!" she said,
looking into his eyes so that he understood this was
not delirium, "I know that you are...."
</p>

<p>
She did not finish, but he understood: "I know
that you are He."
</p>

<p>
Suddenly she trembled in his arms, like a leaf
in a storm.  He laid her down on the bed.
</p>

<p>
Pentu put the mirror to her lips, but this time its
brass surface remained clear.  The rays of the Sun&mdash;a
child's hands&mdash;embraced the body of the dead.
</p>

<p>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
There was the sound of weeping in the chamber.
The women cried, wailed frantically, beat their
breasts, tore their hair, scratched their own faces
till they bled, with a kind of rapture of despair.  But
all was decorous like a holy rite: this was how they
had wailed thousands of years before and how they
would wail thousands of years hence.
</p>

<p>
The king heard the wailing, but there was bitter
laughter in his heart: "you are He!"
</p>

<p class="dropcap">
I want to have Maki buried
according to the ancient custom,"
the queen said.
</p>

<p>
"It shall be as you wish," the
king answered.  He understood
what 'according to the ancient
custom' meant.  The hieroglyphics and mural paintings
of the new tombs in the province of Aton contained
no name or image of the ancient gods, no
prayers, no incantations from the ancient scrolls of
Going out into the World, Unsealing of lips and
eyes, from the Book of the Gates, the Book of what
is beyond the Tomb; no name or image of Osiris
himself, the bringer of life to the dead.
</p>

<p>
It was only now that the king grasped the meaning
of the inscription in Merira's tomb: 'may Aton and
Unnofer revive the flesh on my bones.'  Unnofer was
the Good Spirit, Osiris, the King Akhnaton himself.
There was a challenge and a temptation in it: "if you
are He, conquer death!"
</p>

<p>
"I am not He!  I am not!  I am not!" he wanted
to cry out in terror.
</p>

<p>
The mild fanatic, "the holy fool," Panehesy,
looked straight into his eyes, as though asking: "Will
you renounce the work of your whole life, will you
lie, You-Who-live-in-truth, Ankh-em-maat?"  And
he read in his eyes the answer, "Yes, I will lie."
</p>

<p>
The best embalmers of Thebes, Memphis and
Heliopolis, <i>herhebs</i> and <i>mesras</i>, "divine sealers, cutters
and cleaners," were working at the dead body of
princess Makitatona.
</p>

<p>
Cauldrons were boiling night and day in the
House of Life, the embalming chamber: ointments
and unguents were being cooked&mdash;balm, styrax,
cinnamon, myrrh and cassia; piles of wood were heaped
up&mdash;sandal, terebinth, cedar, currant wood, mastic
and the fragrant wood of the shuu tree; heaps of
incense from Punt in lumps as big as a fist lay about.
Clouds of dust rose over the copper mortars in which
powders were made.  Anyone unaccustomed to these
pungent smells would have fainted coming into the
chamber.
</p>

<p>
For thirty days and thirty nights they were cleaning,
soaking, drying, salting, embalming, smoking
and pickling the body.
</p>

<p>
The king watched everything.  He saw the entrails
being taken out through a slanting slit in the
stomach, and the lapis lazuli sun beetle, Kheper, being
put in the place of the heart.  He heard the cracking
of the bones when the nose was broken and the
brain scooped out with a long flint knife.
</p>

<p>
Eyes of glass were set into the empty sockets.
The hair of the wig, eyebrows and eyelashes was
smoothed carefully.  The nails, finger and toe, were
gilded.  A narrow plaited Osiris's beard in a wooden
box was tied to the chin, for, in the resurrection of
the dead, woman becomes man, the god Osiris.  The
bandage of the god Ra was put round the forehead,
of the god Horus round the neck, of the god Tot on
the ears, of the goddess Hathor on the mouth.  And
the mummy spun round and round like a spindle in
the clever hands that bound it in endless bandages
like a chrysalis in a cocoon.
</p>

<p>
A wooden, crescent-shaped support for the head
was prepared and a prayer to the Sun&mdash;not the new
god, Aton, but to the ancient god Ra&mdash;was written
on a new sheet of papyrus: "Give warmth under
his head.  Do not forget his name.  Come to the
Osiris Makitaton.  His name is the Radiant, the
Ever-Living, the Ancient of Days.  He is Thee."
</p>

<p>
Thus a new great and terrible god Makitaton
grew out of little Maki.
</p>

<p>
Ancient wisdom went hand in hand with ancient
crudeness and childishness: the hieroglyphic of the
serpent in the tomb inscription was cut into two, so
that the snake should not sting the dead, and fledgelings
on the paintings had their feet cut so that they
should not run away.  A silver boat was placed in
the tomb for the dead to sail the Sunset Sea, also a
mirror, rouge, powder, a book of fairy tales and
draughts: the dead could play a game with her soul;
toys were also put in, among them Ankhi's broken
doll, carefully pieced together.
</p>

<p>
A tomb effigy was made for the mummy: the bird
Ba with a human face and hands, the soul of the
dead girl, placing its hands upon her heart and
looking lovingly upon her face was saying:
</p>

<p>
"The heart of my birth, my mother's heart, my
earthly heart, do not forsake me.  Thou art in me;
thou art my Ka, my Double within my body; thou
art Khnum, the Potter who hath made my limbs."
</p>

<p>
The Germinating Osiris was prepared, too: linen
was stretched on a wooden frame, the likeness of
Osiris's mummy was drawn upon it, a thin layer of
black earth was placed over it and thickly sown with
wheat.  The frame was watered until the seeds
germinated; then the crop was cut down smoothly like
grass on the lawn.  This green, spring-like resurrected
body of Osiris was placed in the tomb by the
side of the corpse.  The living seemed to be teaching
the dead: "Look, the seed has come to life&mdash;you do
the same!"
</p>

<p>
The ancient custom was not observed in one respect
only: the head of queen Nefertiti, the earthly
mother, was sculptured in the four corners of the
granite tomb instead of the head of Isis, the heavenly
mother.  When the queen heard of this she was
indignant and rebelled against the king for the first
time in her life.  But it was too late to prepare a new
tomb.
</p>

<p>
On the fortieth day after Maki's death the funeral
procession started out.  The coffin was put into a
boat, the boat into a sledge&mdash;the carriage of the
ancient times when there were no wheels; two pairs of
oxen drew it and the runners slowly creaked on the
white sand of the desert as it were on snow.
</p>

<p>
Mourners dressed in blue&mdash;the colour of the sky,
the colour of death&mdash;walked in front, throwing dust
over their heads with a wail, monotonous like the
howling of jackals.
</p>

<p>
"Weep, weep, weep, O sisters!  Shed tears, shed
endless tears!  Draw your mistress to the West,
oxen, draw her to the West!  Poor darling, you were
so fond of talking to me, why are you silent now,
why don't you speak a word?  So many friends you
had, and now you are alone, alone, alone!  The little
feet that walked so fast, the little hands that held so
tight are bound, confined, tied down.  Weep, weep,
weep, O sisters! shed tears, shed endless tears!"
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The sun was setting when they entered the
Princesses' Valley, with the yawning openings of the
tombs cut in the rocks.  Close by an old fig tree was
an unfading patch of green against the dead sands
and a sweetbriar flowered fragrant with the scent
of honey and roses: the secret waters of an
underground spring kept them fresh.  The drowsy
humming of bees sounded like faraway cymbals.
</p>

<p>
The mummy was placed at the entrance of the
tomb and stood against the yawning blackness of
the cave, bathed in the last radiance of the setting
sun.  Two priests, one wearing the mask of the
jackal-headed Anubis and the other of the falcon-headed
Horus, stood on either side of the mummy,
while the officiating priest, <i>herheb</i>, performing the
sacrament Apra, the opening of lips and eyes, read
the magical words from a papyrus:
</p>

<p>
"Get up, get up, get up, Osiris Makitaton!  I,
thy son Horus, have come to give thee back thy
life, to join thy bones, to bind thy flesh, to put thy
limbs together.  I am Horus, thy son, who gives birth
to his father.  Horus opens thy eyes that they may
see, thy lips that they may Speak, thy ears that they
may hear; he strengthens thy legs that they may
walk and thy arms that they may work!"
</p>

<p>
The priest embraced the mummy, brought his face
near its face and breathed into its mouth.
</p>

<p>
"Thy flesh increases, thy blood flows and all thy
limbs are whole."
</p>

<p>
"I am, I am!  I live, I live!  I shall not know
corruption," another priest, hidden behind the mummy,
answered as though it were itself speaking.
</p>

<p>
"Thou art a god among gods, transfigured,
indestructible, ruling over other gods;" the officiating
priest declared.
</p>

<p>
"I am one.  My being is the being of all the gods
throughout eternity," the mummy answered and the
dead eyes glittered more brightly than the living.
"He is&mdash;I am; I am&mdash;He is."
</p>

<p>
The king fell on his face: he understood that this
new terrible god, Lightgiving, Everlasting, Ancient
of days, Makitaton, had overthrown Aton.
</p>

<p>
He breathed with relief when the body was put
back in the coffin and Makitaton became little Maki
once more.
</p>

<p>
He bent over her, kissed her on the mouth and
put upon her heart a branch of mimosa: the tender,
feathery leaves were to respond with their tremour
to the first stir of the heart at resurrection.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The king spent the night in a tent in the desert,
waiting for sunrise, to say the morning prayers at
the tomb.
</p>

<p>
He could not go to sleep for hours.  At last he got
up, lifted the side of the tent and looked out.  The
Milky Way stretched like a cloud rent in two from
one end of the desert to the other, the Pleiades
glowed, and the seven stars of Tuart the Hippopotamus
glittered with a cold brilliance.  Dead stillness
was all round; only the jackals' howling and
the hooting of owls came from the gorge below.
</p>

<p>
He lay down again and went to sleep.
</p>

<p>
He dreamt he was standing on a square platform
at the top of Cheops' great pyramid.  The desert
below was thronged with a countless multitude of
men: there seemed to be as many heads as there were
grains of sand in the desert; it was as though all
tribes and peoples had gathered together for the last
judgment on him, Uaenra.  They were looking at
him and waiting with bated breath.
</p>

<p>
A puny, black little creature&mdash;Shiha, the eunuch,
or the god Tot himself, the Wise Monkey&mdash;fidgeted
by his side.  The king wanted to push it away and
could not&mdash;he felt weak all over.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly Shiha tore off the king's royal apron,
shenshet, and began whipping him with a switch on
the naked body, saying:
</p>

<p>
"Here's something for you, Akhnaton Uaenra,
Joy of the Sun, Sun's only Son!"
</p>

<p>
He did not hurt him but whipped him respectfully,
as one ought to whip the god-king according to the
mad wisdom of the dream; but the more respectful
it was, the more shameful.
</p>

<p>
And the human multitude down below laughed
frantically, shaking the earth and the sky with its
laughter.  The sun in heaven, a red monstrous face,
bared its teeth, turning crimson with laughter; it
stretched out its long hand-shaped rays and made
a long nose at him.
</p>

<p>
And Shiha went on whipping him and saying:
</p>

<p>
"Ah, you naughty boy, you shameless little creature,
you have disgraced yourself before all the
world!  Take this, son of man, son of god!"
</p>

<p>
The king woke up, recalled his dream and felt as
frightened and ashamed in reality as he did in the
dream.
</p>

<p>
He lay for some time in the dark with his eyes
open.  There was a lump in his throat, his breath
failed him as before an epileptic fit; the inhuman
scream was ready to burst from his throat.  "What
shall I do?  What shall I do?" he thought with
anguish.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly he felt easier&mdash;something had been
loosened, the lump in the throat had melted away.
He got up and walked out of the tent.
</p>

<p>
The sky was rose-green and the rose-green waves
of the sand seemed as ethereal as the sky.  The
morning star bright as the sun glittered in the heavens.
Not a man, not a beast, not a bird, not a tree, not
even a blade of grass&mdash;only the sky and the
earth&mdash;endless freedom, infinite expanse.
</p>

<p>
Akhnaton raised his eyes to the star and smiled.
All at once he seemed to have understood what he
was to do.
</p>

<p>
With joy, as though his words were enough to
conquer death&mdash;the mocking laughter&mdash;he whispered:
</p>

<p>
"To go away!  To go away!"
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p class="dropcap">
Saakera came up to Dio, his face
so distorted that she hardly knew
him.
</p>

<p>
"The king is waiting for you,
go to him," he said, and was about
to go when she stopped him.
</p>

<p>
"What has happened, prince?"
</p>

<p>
"He will tell you himself, go to him."
</p>

<p>
"I am keeping watch; I must wait till I am relieved."
</p>

<p>
"Never mind.  I will take your place."
</p>

<p>
Dio ran up the stairs to the flat roof of Aton's
temple.
</p>

<p>
The day was just dawning.  The sky seemed
empty and glassy like the open eye of a corpse.  The
waters of the river looked leaden.  The earth was
under the spell of sleep.  The town below appeared
dead.  It was the hour when men's sleep is like death
as is said in the hymn to Aton:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Men sleep in darkness like the dead,<br>
  Their heads are wrapped up, their nostrils stopped,<br>
  Stolen are all their things that are under their heads,<br>
  While they know it not.<br>
  Every lion comes forth from his den,<br>
  All serpents creep out of their holes,<br>
  The creator has gone to rest and the world is silent.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The white walls of the temple were dull-green
as though under water.  All was dead; only on the
great altar of the Sun a perpetual fire was burning
and the sun disc of Aton above it&mdash;the highest point
of the whole huge edifice&mdash;glowed with a dull-red
glow as though a ray of an invisible sun were
reflected in it.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Dio saw the king in the distance, but she did not
recognise him at once.  He was sitting on the altar
steps in a curiously cramped attitude, with his chin
resting against his knees and his face buried in his
hands.  "Sitting on their heels in the dust," she
recalled the refrain of the Babylonian song about the
dead in the underworld, mournful as the howling of
the night wind.  He probably did not hear her step,
for he did not stir.  She did not dare to call him,
thinking he was asleep.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly he raised his head and looked at her
in a way that made her heart stand still.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, Dio!  Have you seen Saakera?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"Has he told you what I wanted to say to you?"
</p>

<p>
"No."
</p>

<p>
"Sit down."
</p>

<p>
She sat down beside him.  He took her hand,
kissed the palm of it and smiled in a way that
wrung her heart again.
</p>

<p>
"There, now I have forgotten.  I remember what
I wanted to say, but I can't think how to say it.
It must be the fit that has made me so forgetful."
</p>

<p>
She understood he was referring to the epileptic
fit he had had recently.
</p>

<p>
He stretched himself so that the knuckles of his
fingers cracked, and yawned loudly.  Two deep
wrinkles formed round his mouth.  He looked like
the ancient Sphinx with the face of Akhnaton.
</p>

<p>
"Do you remember my telling you, Dio, that my
kingdom was coming to an end?  Well, it has come
to an end.  I want to go away."
</p>

<p>
"How go away?  Where?"
</p>

<p>
"Anywhere, so long as I go away from here,
escape out of this prison....  But why do you ask?
You know it all better than I do."
</p>

<p>
"But how are you to go?  Will they let you?"
</p>

<p>
"No one is to know, except you and Saakera.
You two will help me.  He has already promised."
</p>

<p>
"Promised what?"
</p>

<p>
"I will tell you.  It was he who killed Maki; she
had the child by him.  He has just confessed it.  He
is so wretched that he wants to kill himself and
drink the remainder of the poison out of Merira's
ring, my present to him.  But I have thought of a
worse punishment for him: he is to be king when
I go away."
</p>

<p>
"But can he do it?"
</p>

<p>
"He will be no worse than I am.  And it won't
be for long: he will hand over the power to Horemheb,
the Viceroy of the North.  Horemheb refuses
to be king so long as I live, but I expect he will agree
when I am dead."
</p>

<p>
"How, when you are dead?"
</p>

<p>
"When I go away I shall be dead to all.  No one
will know that I have gone, and those who hear of
it will not believe it but will think me dead."
</p>

<p>
Dio knew that Horemheb was an enemy of Aton's
faith.  Would the king ruin the work of his whole
life by putting him into power?  She wanted to ask
the question, but felt she had better not.
</p>

<p>
"This is how Saakera is going to help me," the
king went on.  "We shall set out for Memphis
together to see Horemheb and on the way I shall go
ashore somewhere in the night&mdash;and that will be
the last they will see of me."
</p>

<p>
"Will you go alone?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  I will take off my royal dress, put on the
clothes of a nab priest&mdash;you know, those that walk
about the high roads collecting money for the
temples, and go off with a staff and wallet."
</p>

<p>
"What for?  What will you do?"
</p>

<p>
"What I have done all my life.  Do you remember,
Iserker said 'Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make
His paths straight'?  Well, I shall be preparing it.
I will leave the great and go to the small, leave the
first and go to the last; the first have not heard
me&mdash;perhaps the last will...."
</p>

<p>
He was saying extraordinary things in a dull,
dreary way.  He kept yawning; perhaps those who
'sit in the dust on their heels in the underworld'
yawn like that, too.
</p>

<p>
"Well, why are you silent?  Do you think I am mad?"
</p>

<p>
"No, it isn't that...."
</p>

<p>
"Speak, don't be afraid."
</p>

<p>
"I think .... forgive me, sire, but all you kings
are like babies: you don't know what poor, hard life
is like.  As soon as you have gone you will perish
senselessly&mdash;of thirst, of hunger, from a wild beast,
or a brigand's knife.  You will be like a naked child
on naked earth...."
</p>

<p>
"'Be merciful to yourself, Uaenra!'  Is that it?
Do you remember who said it?  My friend, Merira.
No, Dio, my Father will not leave me.  He who
preserves worms and midges of the air will not forsake
a man.  And what is more terrible&mdash;a robber's knife
or Tuta's flattery, thirst in the desert or Merira's
poison?  Isn't this so, Dio the prophetess?"
</p>

<p>
"It is.  But I shall say, like Merira again: can't
a king do more good than a beggar?"
</p>

<p>
He laughed.
</p>

<p>
"No, you are not Merira.  You don't believe what
you are saying.  I have reigned for many years and
much good I have done!  Ramose is right: nothing
is more vile than empty noble words, nothing more
wicked than empty good words.  I thought I could
make people happy, bring heaven down to earth&mdash;and
this is the happiness I have bestowed upon
them: blood is being shed everywhere between the
Delta and the Waterfalls, it is hell upon earth.  I
wanted to efface the boundaries of the fields, to make
the poor equal with the rich, and what has happened
is that the whole of Egypt is like a dirty Jews'
village where people live and die like cattle in perfect
equality!  And it is all done by the decree of the
king Who-lives-in-Truth&mdash;Ankh-em-Maat&mdash;a fine
name!  Iserker wanted to stab me, Merira to poison
me, but isn't it doing me too much honour?  To spit
into the liar's face would be punishment enough....
Do you ever have shameful dreams, Dio, so ridiculous
that one could die of laughter?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I know."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, so you have them, too....  Well, I have had
such a dream&mdash;I nearly died of laughter.  To laugh
at oneself is death.  'I am He,' is what I laugh at,
what is killing me.  Laughter will kill me one day
like epilepsy....  Dio, Dio, if you love me, save me,
help me!"
</p>

<p>
"How can I help you?"
</p>

<p>
"Stay with her!"
</p>

<p>
She understood: with the queen.
</p>

<p>
"Does she know?"
</p>

<p>
"No."
</p>

<p>
"How then will you .... deceive her?"
</p>

<p>
"I can't deceive her&mdash;she will find out.  But if at
least it weren't just now, after Maki's death&mdash;one
wound on the top of another....  Later on, when
everything is over, you will tell her, you alone will
know how to tell her so that she should forgive
me...."
</p>

<p>
"No, she won't forgive, and if she does...."
</p>

<p>
"I know, you need not tell me!  Oh, it would be
better if she didn't forgive me!  But she is sure to
forgive....  What am I to do, what am I to do?
To stay is to kill myself: to go away is to kill her,
to trample upon her heart? ... Help me, stay with
her.  Perhaps you will save her.  Remember, if she
dies I shall die, too."
</p>

<p>
"You ask me for a miracle?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, do a miracle&mdash;a miracle of love.  You do
love her, don't you?  Love her to the end.  Relieve
me of my burden and take it upon yourself.  Will
you?"
</p>

<p>
"I will."
</p>

<p>
She was silent for a while and then asked:
</p>

<p>
"You will go away and I shall never see you again?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, you will; I will call you as soon as I can
and we will go to Him together!"
</p>

<p>
He spoke no more, and raising his knees as before
put his chin on them and wept, covering his face
with his hands.
</p>

<p>
She put her arm round his head and pressed it
to her bosom, stroking it gently with the other hand.
</p>

<p>
Shiha, the eunuch, was right: the king did not
know how to cry: he swallowed his tears convulsively,
choked, trembled as in a shivering fit.  But Dio's
caress gradually calmed him, and he only shuddered
from time to time with a sob like a child tired of
crying.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps you are right," he began again, "and I
shall perish senselessly.  Saakera wants to kill
himself; perhaps I do also....  Dio, my sister, oh if
you only could...."
</p>

<p>
"What is it?  Tell me."
</p>

<p>
"If you could only tell me whether I ought to go away?"
</p>

<p>
Dio knew that the right answer was "no one but
yourself can tell."  But she also knew that saying
this would mean abandoning him&mdash;the naked child
upon the naked earth.
</p>

<p>
She pressed his head to her bosom and said:
</p>

<p>
"You ought."
</p>

<p>
The trumpets down below played the hymn to Aton:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Glorious is Thy rising in the East<br>
  Lord and giver of life, Aton!"<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The dead sky revived and turned rosy.  A red
ember blazed up in the misty gorge of the Arabian
mountains and the first ray of the sun glittered on
Aton's disc.
</p>

<p>
The king rose, took Dio by the hand and led her
up the sloping approach to the great altar of the
Sun.  He turned to the East, raised his arms and
said:
</p>

<p>
"I come to glorify thy rays, living Aton..."
</p>

<p>
But his voice failed him: he suddenly felt that he
could no longer pray to Aton.
</p>

<p>
He fell on his knees and cried:
</p>

<p>
"My God, my God, have mercy upon me, a
sinner!  In thee have I put my trust, let me never be
ashamed...."
</p>

<p>
And with a sob he beat his head against the
flagstones:
</p>

<p>
"Let me never, never be ashamed!"
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
On the twenty-ninth day of the month of Hoyak,
December, on the thirteenth anniversary of the
foundation of the City of the Sun and the day of Aton's
nativity, the king set out on his journey.
</p>

<p>
Everyone wondered at his breaking his oath not
to leave the domain of Aton, but they did not wonder
very much; it was the privilege of a king and a god
to release himself from his vows, and besides, many
had noticed that his fervour for the new faith had
begun to cool.  The decree prohibiting the worship
of the gods had never been declared after all, and
the day of departure was fixed on the very day of
the great festival, as though on purpose to cancel it.
</p>

<p>
The king made no secret of his journey: he was
going to Memphis to see Horemheb, the Viceroy
of the North, to persuade him to take Saakera's
place as heir to the throne.  Sensible people rejoiced:
they did not want Saakera for king; there was
nothing to be proud of in being ruled by a king who
had his ears boxed by his Ethiopian concubine;
Horemheb, the husband of the queen's sister, Nezemmut,
a direct descendant of the great king Tutmose the
Third, had every right to reign; the gods themselves
had commanded him to do so.  "The gods rocked
thy cradle," as it said in the song of Amon's priests.
He was a faithful servant of the king and was not
implicated in any court or priestly intrigue; but he
had not been false to the faith of his fathers, had
not worshipped the new god, and the enemies of
Aton hoped he would destroy the work of the
apostate king and restore the old gods.
</p>

<p>
Everyone rejoiced except the queen.  The parting
from her husband frightened her; she had never
been parted from him during the fifteen years of
their married life.  Did she suspect anything?  If she
did she showed no sign of it, but submitted without
a murmur.  She did not ask him to take her with
him&mdash;she knew he would not; and besides she could
not leave Rita, who was ill.  And she herself was
not well: she had a racking cough, was feverish at
night and there was an ominous flush in her cheeks.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The king had not been seen so joyful for years as
he was on the day of his departure.  Only when he
took leave of the queen a shadow passed over his
face; but he looked at Dio and was happy again.
</p>

<p>
The crowd on the quay was joyful, too.  When
the king's ship set sail, a white falcon, the bird of
Horus, circled over it, foretelling a happy journey.
</p>

<p>
The people stood for some time watching the
three ships, magnificently painted and gilded&mdash;marvels
of gold, purple, and azure, half birds, half
flowers&mdash;glide along the white water: after the
overflow the Nile turns white 'like the milk of Isis.'
</p>

<p>
Memphis was four hundred <i>aters</i> from the City
of the Sun, down the river.
</p>

<p>
The further the king went the happier he was, as
though he had, indeed, escaped from prison.  It made
him happy that the yellow streak of the dead sands
and the black of fertile earth stretched on either
side of the river simply, quietly and monotonously:
life and death side by side in eternal union, eternal
peace; that the slow oxen were drawing deep
furrows in rich earth and the bright green crops
already showed here and there, and the monotonous
singing of the ploughman echoed far in the stillness
of the fields.
</p>

<p>
A deserted temple of the Sun, built a thousand
years before Akhnaton, stood at the edge of the
desert in the middle of a great pyramid cemetery,
within four or five hours' journey from Memphis
down the river.
</p>

<p>
A full moon, huge and red-hot, was rising beyond
the Arabian Mountains when the king's ship stopped
by the temple.  The king, Saakera and two priests,
with sacred utensils, the bread of offering, wine for
libations and incense, came ashore.
</p>

<p>
The only priest and guardian of the temple, an
old man of a hundred years, met them and wept
when he heard that the king wanted to offer a
sacrifice: the last person to visit the temple was
king Tutmose the Fourth, Akhnaton's grandfather.
</p>

<p>
They walked from the harbour to the temple
down a long covered passage.  On the large flat roof
of the temple a huge obelisk, the Sun stone, Ben-ben,
stood on a pyramid-shaped base, facing an altar
made of five huge blocks of alabaster, exactly like
the one in the City of the Sun, on the roof of Aton's
temple.
</p>

<p>
The king burned incense, made the libation and
prayed in silence for a few minutes.  Then he sent
everyone away and walked with Saakera to the secret
gates that led into the desert.  He gave him a scroll
of papyrus&mdash;his resignation from the throne, and a
letter to Horemheb, in which he implored him to
save Egypt and accept the crown.
</p>

<p>
When Saakera had sworn that all should be done,
the king embraced and kissed him on the mouth
and, taking off his royal tiara, with a golden snake
of the sun, Uta, over the forehead, put it on Saakera's
head; he took off all his royal robes, put on the
dress of a wandering priest, <i>uab</i>, slung a wallet over
his shoulder, took a staff in his hand and walked
out of the gate.
</p>

<p>
The full, dazzlingly bright moon stood high in
the starless sky.  Coal-black shadows fell upon the
white sand that sparkled like snow with sapphire
sparks, and the black triangles of the pyramids stood
out against the sky on the distant horizon.
</p>

<p>
Saakera watched the king go.  He walked as
though he had been a wanderer all his life, with a
light quick step, along a faint path&mdash;a jackals' track&mdash;to
the neighbouring fishing village, Ptah-Sokkaris,
consisting of some two dozen mud huts.
</p>

<p>
His figure grew smaller as he walked away; he
had been the size of an animal, now he was the size
of a bird, a mouse, an ant, a point, and finally he
disappeared, melted away in the fire of the moon.
</p>

<p>
"Strange!" Saakera thought, unconscious of the
tears that were trickling down his face.  "There is
no God, I know there isn't, then why...?"
</p>

<p>
He broke off and started as though someone else
had finished for him:
</p>

<p>
"There is God, there is!  It is because there is God
that he has gone away!"
</p>

<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-t.png" width="126" height="126" alt="T">
</div>

<p class="dropcap">
The pyramid cemetery of the ancient
kings stretched along the edge of
the desert from Memphis to
Heliopolis&mdash;a three days' journey.
</p>

<p>
A great battle of men with death
had once been fought here; death
conquered, men ran away, the field became a desert;
only the pyramids remained like fortresses, besieged
but not taken.
</p>

<p>
In the very middle of the cemetery, in the plain
of Rostia, the three largest pyramids stood&mdash;those
of Menkaur, Hafra and Cheops.  The many hundred-weight
blocks of stone over the king's tomb within
were packed so close together that a needle could not
be thrust between them; outside, the mirror-like
facing of sandstone was so perfect that the pyramids
looked like huge crystals.  The eternal triangles,
rising from the earth to one point in the sky,
proclaimed to men the mystery of Three: "I began to be
as one God, but three Gods were within me."
</p>

<p>
All the other tombs had been destroyed; the royal
mummies had been thrown out and lay about in the
sand, turning to dust under the feet of the
passers-by.  Bats, hyenas and jackals lived in the tombs.
Thieves had plundered them for a thousand years,
but had not yet succeeded in clearing everything
away.
</p>

<p>
As the blind singers sang at feasts:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "I have heard of what befell my forefathers:<br>
  The walls of their tombs are destroyed,<br>
  Their coffins are empty like coffins of beggars,<br>
  Forsaken by everyone on earth.<br>
  Their dwelling-place is no more.<br>
  It is as though they had never been.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
In a wild rock close by that looked like a lion at
rest, the great Sphinx was carved, no one knew by
whom and when.  Its face was the first human face
sculptured in stone.  Its names were Ra-Harmahu&mdash;the
Sun-at-the-edge-of-the-horizon; Khu-Zeshep&mdash;Shining
Terror, and Kheper&mdash;Rising from the
Dead.
</p>

<p>
Perpetually buried by the sand, it lifted its head
from under it with a mysterious smile on the flat
lips, to see the first ray of the rising sun; and there
was the dazzling terror of death and resurrection
in its eyes of stone.
</p>

<p>
Not far from the Sphinx stood a temple built
also no one knew when and by whom.  The square
pillars and rafters of such enormous stones that one
could hardly believe them to have been carved by
human hands were of black granite; all was smooth,
bare and divinely simple.
</p>

<p>
The temple had not been destroyed and, indeed,
there was nothing to destroy in it; but it had fallen
into decay like everything around it.  The high road
from Memphis to Heliopolis went past it and part
of the temple had been turned into an inn.  The
alabaster floors were dirty and the mirror-like
granite had turned dull with the smoke of kitchen
fires.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
One day towards the end of winter shepherds
were keeping the night watch in the field of Rostia;
the tombs in the hills close by served as cattle sheds.
They lighted a bonfire of manure bricks and straw
right at the foot of the Sphinx.  The night was cold;
the tall grass was white with hoar frost.
</p>

<p>
Wayfarers who had not been able to obtain
shelter at the inn settled by the shepherds' bonfire.
Issachar was among them.  When King Akhnaton
had left the City of the Sun for Memphis, he went
after him and, not finding him there, set out in
search of him.  Issachar's uncle, the merchant
Ahiram, who was going with his young daughter-in-law,
Tabitha, to the town of Tanis on business, was
there, too, and so was Yubra, the former slave of
Khnumhotep; wounded in the Nut-Amon rising, he
had only just recovered after a long illness.
</p>

<p>
"Blessed is He who cometh in the name of the
Lord," Yubra was saying.  "He shall come down
like rain upon the freshly cut meadow, like dew upon
parched-up earth.  He shall save the souls of the
humble and the oppressor he shall lay low...."
</p>

<p>
"Of whom are you speaking?" asked Merik, a
shepherd, with a kind and intelligent face somewhat
like that of King Hafra, the pyramid builder, whose
effigies stood in the temple by the inn.  "Do you
mean the new prophet?"
</p>

<p>
"No, the One of Whom the prophet speaks."
</p>

<p>
"Prophets prophesy, magpies chatter and it makes
no difference to us one way or another," grunted
Mermose, a sickly-looking man with a sarcastic
smile on his thin lips, a saltworker from the Miuer
lakes.
</p>

<p>
"Very true!  Prophets are no use to poor people,"
Anupu, an old peasant, confirmed.  Rough and
shaggy he looked like a tree-stump dug out of
the ground and covered with earth.  He had been
silent, eating bread soaked in water and wrapping
his sheepskin closer round him, but suddenly he
grew lively and began talking as though he had
recalled something.
</p>

<p>
"I have dragged the plough myself for forty
years&mdash;never had any money to buy oxen; and you
know how little land we have.  And the summer
before last part of the bank was washed away
during the overflow and a quarter of my field had
fallen into the river and the house very nearly went,
too.  Tax collectors came: 'You are in great arrears,
Anupu,' they said, 'sixty bushels of wheat, sixty of
spelt and a hundred and seventy of barley.'  'I have
nothing at all,' I said, 'have patience with me,
fathers!'  'No,' they said, 'the treasury cannot wait,
lie down.'  And one made a sign behind the other's
back to give him a bribe, but I had nothing to do
it with.  So they laid me out and gave me a flogging,
and to my wife, too&mdash;she had stood up for me and
abused them.  And they sent me to clean the canals
in Set's salt marshes during the very fierce heat.  I
had to stand up to my knees in water, devoured by
midges, shaking with fever.  I still get a shivering
fit when the night comes on.  And a neighbour
told me the other day that my wife is dead, my house
has tumbled down, my two sons have been taken for
the army, and my daughter has been led astray by
some Midian merchants.  I have nothing now to
return to....  And so I say, what is the use of
prophets to me?"
</p>

<p>
Merik added some straw to the bonfire.  The
flames leapt up, lighting the face of the Sphinx in the
black starry sky.  Tabitha, with a baby in her arms,
was sleeping between the Sphinx's lion paws.
</p>

<p>
Tabitha means 'gazelle.'  She had the eyes of a
gazelle, the long, dark eyelashes of a child, and such
a smile that Merik's son User, a young man with a
sad and girlishly charming face, wanted to cry with
happiness at the sight of her.  He looked at her as
though he were praying: he fancied that she was
Mother Isis with the baby Horus and that the
Shining Terror fixed its stony eyes into the starlit
darkness merely so that it might watch over the
Mother and the Babe.
</p>

<p>
"It goes ill with peasants, but soldiers are no
better off," said a thin little old man, rather like a
grasshopper&mdash;a retired centurion, Aziri.  "A soldier
climbs up the hills carrying burdens like a donkey,
drinks water out of pools like a dog; when he sees
the enemy he trembles like a bird in a net; and when
he comes home he is covered with wounds, cankered
with illness, like an old wormeaten tree; he cannot
work and is ashamed to beg&mdash;he may as well lie
down and die."
</p>

<p>
He did not say it, but all understood "prophets
are no use to a soldier."
</p>

<p>
"Come, friends, don't be so gloomy," Merik said,
looking round at them all with a serene smile.  "I
have lived in the world for forty years, I have seen
much evil, but also a great deal of good.  One can't
say of a man's life that it is quite good, nor that it
is quite bad either; it's all mixed up; to-day is bad,
to-morrow will be better."
</p>

<p>
"No, it won't be better," Mermose retorted.  "It
is bad now but it will be worse.  It is written in the
ancient scrolls: 'the Lord will give men a tremulous
heart, their eyes shall melt away, their souls shall
pine and they shall tremble night and day; in the day
they shall say, 'oh, if it were night!' and at night 'oh,
if it were day!'  'The sky over their head shall be
brass and the earth under their feet shall be iron
and dust shall fall upon them till they all perish.'"
</p>

<p>
"No, they will not perish: the Saviour will come
and save the perishing," Yubra said, simply and
quietly.
</p>

<p>
"How will he save them, by the sword or by the
word?" asked a puny little man, with a spotty face,
a sharp red little nose and squinting, shifty eyes.
He was a scribe, dismissed from the service,
Herihor or Heri, a quarrelsome, debauched and
backbiting man, as one could see from his face.
</p>

<p>
"And what do you think?" Yubra answered
evasively: he was afraid of Heri who was said to
be a spy.
</p>

<p>
Heri did not answer at once; he had a pull at his
flask and then said, with a wink:
</p>

<p>
"The sword.  Or, if there is no sword at hand,
with an axe or a stick.  Until we get the rich by
the throat and give their fat bellies a shake, they
won't give back what they have plundered....  But
it's enough babbling, we must act!"
</p>

<p>
"How?"
</p>

<p>
"Raise a cry throughout the world, 'rise up, rebel,
paupers, kill, plunder, burn!'  A great fire will be
kindled and a thing that has never been will happen;
beggars will be as gods and then the earth will
turn upside down like a potter's wheel!"
</p>

<p>
"You should not say such things, my son!"
Ahiram stopped him.  "You must not rail against
the rulers even in your thoughts, nor speak evil
against the rich in your own chamber, for a bird of
the air may carry your words."
</p>

<p>
"A-ah, you are afraid?  Well, then it's no use
talking," Heri laughed and he drained the last drop
out of his flask.
</p>

<p>
"But who are you, where do you come from?"
Yubra asked with sudden alarm.
</p>

<p>
"And who are you and your prophet?  Tramps, I
expect, runaway slaves, rogues, game for the
gallows, we have seen enough of such, ugh!"
</p>

<p>
He paused, looking round at them all with sleepy
but still cunning eyes, and then spoke amiably again.
</p>

<p>
"Come, dear old man, don't be cross, let us kiss!
Ah, mates, I am sorry for you!  You are poor,
ignorant people, anyone can injure you and there's
no one to stand up for you.  And I am so fond of
poor people&mdash;I am ready to lay down my life for
them!"
</p>

<p>
And suddenly bending down to Yubra, he whispered
in his ear: "Do you know Kiki the Noseless?
He is a man of sense, cleverer than any prophet.
They say he is stirring things up again on the Upper
Nile!  That's the man to join!  Shall I take you
to him?"
</p>

<p>
Yubra said nothing, and drew back.  All were
silent, as though they really were afraid to speak.
</p>

<p>
Far away in the desert the hungry roar of a
lion was heard suddenly, and the dogs by the sheep-fold
barked and howled frantically.
</p>

<p>
Merik rose and thanking his guests for their
conversation with stately courtesy typical of the men
of the desert, went with two shepherds on his watch
round.  The others began to settle down for the
night on the warm sand by the bonfire, wrapping
themselves in furs and cloaks.
</p>

<p>
Issachar went up to Yubra and said, taking him
aside:
</p>

<p>
"May I see the prophet?"
</p>

<p>
"Why not?  Everyone will see him to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
Isaachar paused and, looking round to see if
anyone was listening, asked in a whisper:
</p>

<p>
"Who is he, where does he come from?"
</p>

<p>
"A <i>uab</i> priest, but where he comes from I do not
know."
</p>

<p>
"You really don't know or don't want to tell me?"
</p>

<p>
"No, I really don't know."
</p>

<p>
"And what is his name?"
</p>

<p>
"Neser-Bata."
</p>

<p>
Issachar knew that Bata was one of the names of
Osiris: the Soul of Bread, of God's flesh broken
and eaten by men; and Neser meant offspring, Son.
Neser Bata&mdash;Son of Osiris, second Osiris.
</p>

<p>
"Are you an Israelite?" Yubra asked.
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"Your Moses is a great prophet, but this one is
greater than he."
</p>

<p>
"Only one Man on earth will be greater than
Moses&mdash;do you know Who?"
</p>

<p>
"I know."
</p>

<p>
Issachar looked at Yubra as though wishing to
ask something else.
</p>

<p>
"You will see for yourself and know," Yubra said
in answer to that silent question, and walked away.
</p>

<p>
Issachar lay down by the bonfire, wrapping his
cloak round him, but could not go to sleep for
thinking about the prophet.  There was something in
Yubra's words and reservations that suggested the
mysterious smile of Khu-Zeshep, the Shining
Terror.  He dropped asleep just before daybreak; he
vaguely heard the distant roar of the lion and
remembered the voice crying in the wilderness:
'Prepare the way of the Lord, make His paths straight.'
</p>

<p>
Merik's son, too, could not go to sleep that night:
he kept looking as though in prayer at the mother
with the child asleep between the lion paws of the
Sphinx.
</p>

<p>
Tabitha's ass dozed, hanging its head.  The flame
of the dying fire seemed to stand like a fine and sharp
sword in the still air.  From the low-lying meadows
down by the river came the melancholy call of the
hoopoo.  The stars grew dim and twinkled like
flames blown out by the wind.  The sky turned white
and rosy and there glowed in it a star, pure and
dazzling like the sun.  A red-hot ember blazed up in
the misty gorge of the Arabian Mountains and the
first ray of the sun lighted the Sphinx's face.
</p>

<p>
The baby woke up and cried.  The mother gave
him the breast.  Then she held him up, showing him
the sun.  The boy laughed and stretched out his
arms as though he would seize the sun.
</p>

<p>
The same mystery was in the smile of the baby
as in the smile of the Sphinx.  User fell on his face
and worshipped Baby Horus&mdash;the Shining Terror.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Issachar woke up when the sun had already risen
above the palm trees.  He jumped up, afraid of
having slept too late and missed the prophet.
</p>

<p>
Some people were hurrying past him.
</p>

<p>
"Where are you going?" he asked them.
</p>

<p>
"To Ieket-Chufu, to hear the prophet," they
answered.
</p>

<p>
He followed them.  Walking ankle-deep in sand
along a trade between sharp, projecting rocks, they
climbed on to the flat top of the hill Ieket-Chufu,
facing the Great Pyramid of the same name.  In the
shadow the grass was still white with hoar-frost,
but in the sun it had melted and fell in drops clear
and bright as tears.
</p>

<p>
The expanse seen from the top of the hill was
boundless: sands, yellow as the lion's hair, stretching
to the edge of the horizon; bluish-green meadows
and palm groves by the river; golden points of the
Heliopolis obelisks, sparkling against the bare
parched rocks of the Arabian hills purple as amethyst
and yellow as topaz; and close by, opposite the
hill, the huge pale phantom of Cheops' pyramid
glimmering in the rosy sunlit mist.  The perfect
triangles rising from the earth to one point in the
sky proclaimed to men the mystery of Three: "I
began to be as one God but three Gods were in
me."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The people crowding on the flat top of the hill
surrounded the prophet so closely that Issachar
could not squeeze his way to him.  The lame, the
halt, the dumb, the blind were among the crowd, as
well as lepers, paralytics and men possessed by the
devil.  Neser-Bata laid his hands upon them with
prayer and they were healed.  Then he stood on a
hillock in the middle of the plateau.  The sun rising
behind him surrounded the prophet with dazzling
brilliance that seemed to come from his body.  Issachar
could not see his face.  "Thy flesh is the flesh
of the Sun; thy limbs are beautiful rays.  In truth
thou dost proceed from the Sun as the child from its
mother's womb," he recalled the words of the service
to Aton.
</p>

<p>
The prophet's voice was heard and the crowd grew
so still that one could hear the drops of melting
hoar-frost falling to the ground.  The sound of that
voice was so familiar that Issachar's heart throbbed
with an incredible presentiment.  He looked down:
he was afraid of seeing and recognizing him.
</p>

<p>
Neser-Bata was speaking of the second Osiris,
of the Son who was to come, of Him Whom the
prophets of Israel called the Messiah.
</p>

<p>
Issachar raised his eyes, saw and recognized: "it
is he!" and covered his face with his hands as
though blinded by the sun.  Yet he did not believe
his eyes and looked once more, but by that time
the prophet had gone down from the hillock and
could not be seen for the crowd.
</p>

<p>
Issachar went up to Yubra and said:
</p>

<p>
"I want to speak to Neser-Bata."
</p>

<p>
"Go down to Khu-Zeshep, he will walk past
there," Yubra answered.
</p>

<p>
Issachar walked down the hill and sat down on
the sand at the foot of the Sphinx.
</p>

<p>
The sun was rising and the black shadow of the
great pyramid slowly moved along the white sand
like the shadow on a sundial measuring out minutes
and ages, the passage of time and eternity.  "How
many minutes&mdash;how many ages will it be till He
comes?" Issachar thought.
</p>

<p>
He suddenly saw Neser-Bata coming towards him
down the hill.  He went to meet him, fell at his
feet and cried:
</p>

<p>
"Rejoice, Akhnaton, King of Egypt!"
</p>

<p>
He gazed into his face still unable to believe his
eyes; he recognized him and yet he did not.
</p>

<p>
The prophet looked at him in silence and said,
shaking his head:
</p>

<p>
"No, my son, you are mistaken, I am a beggar and
a wanderer, Bata.  And who are you?"
</p>

<p>
"Issachar, son of Hamuel, the one who wanted
to kill you.  Don't you know me?"
</p>

<p>
Suddenly Bata bent quickly down to him and
whispered:
</p>

<p>
"If you love me, don't tell!"
</p>

<p>
And he looked into his eyes.  There was such power
in that look that had he said "die!" Issachar would
have died.
</p>

<p>
But when Bata turned to go he embraced his feet
and asked:
</p>

<p>
"May I follow you?"
</p>

<p>
"No, you may not.  Go your way and I shall go
mine: we shall both come to Him and meet there."
</p>

<p>
"To Him?  But aren't you....?"
</p>

<p>
He gazed into his face once more, terror-stricken:
it suddenly seemed to him that this was neither the
beggar Bata, nor the king of Egypt, Akhnaton, but
Someone else.
</p>

<p>
"Who are you?  Who are you?  I adjure you by
the living God, who are you?" he whispered
desperately.
</p>

<p>
The prophet shook his head and smiling pointed
to the black shadow on the white sand.
</p>

<p>
"Do you see my shadow?  As this shadow is from
me, I am from Him.  He comes after me but I
am not He!"
</p>

<p>
He said it and walked along the foot of the
Sphinx, followed by his shadow.  He turned the
corner and disappeared, and the shadow disappeared
too.  Only the light footprints were left on the white
sand.
</p>

<p>
Issachar bent down and not daring to kiss them
kissed the sand where the shadow had passed.

</div>

<p class="dropcap">
There was a riot in Busiris, a town
in the Northern district.
</p>

<p>
As usual it was started by the
Israelites working in the brick
factories when they were no longer
given any chopped straw necessary
for making bricks, but were ordered to chop it
themselves, while producing the usual quantity of
bricks.  Porters and loaders from the harbour joined
them when they heard that boys younger than fifteen
were to be taken for the army.  The mothers said
indignantly, "What is the good of bearing sons?
They are no sooner grown up than they are driven
to the slaughter, and you, their fathers, put up with
it!"  Part of the garrison of Kidjevadan mercenaries,
who had received in their monthly ration nasty smelling
sesame oil instead of olive oil for ointment, also
joined the rioters.
</p>

<p>
Usirmar, son of Ziamon, the governor of the province
of Busiris and an old soldier of the times of
Tutmose the Fourth, sternly put down the rebellion.
With a number of other rioters the tramp Bata, the
slave Yubra and the Jew Avinoam&mdash;this was the
assumed name of Issachar&mdash;denounced by the scribe
Herihor, were seized as the chief culprits.
</p>

<p>
"This accursed Bata," so the denunciation ran, "a
godless and seditious fellow, having gathered a band
of thieves and brigands like himself, intended to
cause rebellion not only in the Busiris province, but
throughout Egypt, preaching that people should not
obey the authorities and that they should refuse to
serve in the army, that the poor ought to be equal
to the rich, saying that the boundaries between fields
should be effaced and the land be common property,
and wealth taken from the rich and given to the poor.
The said accursed man blasphemes against the gracious
god-king and says in his vain talk that there
is only one King in heaven and on earth&mdash;the god
Ra-Aton."
</p>

<p>
The denunciation was illiterate but cleverly put
together.  It was a troubled time.  Horemheb, the
governor of the North, had just set out to the eastern
province, Goshen, to put down a rising of the
Israelites who were always dreaming of a second Exodus,
and to repulse the attack of the Sinai nomads against
the Great Wall of Egypt.  Terrible rumours reached
Usirmar of King Akhnaton's madness, suicide,
or assassination, of a new rising in Thebes and
an imminent war between the two rivals for the
throne, Saakera and Tutankhaton.
</p>

<p>
The riotous band of the false prophet, Bata, might
be the first spark of a new conflagration.
</p>

<p>
When Bata had been brought in fetters from the
prison to the governor's white house, Usirmar
ordered everyone out of the room and looked at
him with surprise: he was so unlike a criminal.
Usirmar had seen King Akhnaton only once, some
twenty years ago, and would not have known
him now.
</p>

<p>
"What is your name?" he asked the prisoner.
</p>

<p>
"Bata."
</p>

<p>
"Whose son are you?"
</p>

<p>
"God's."
</p>

<p>
"Are you joking?  Take care."
</p>

<p>
"No, I am not joking.  I do not know my earthly
father; I know only the Heavenly."
</p>

<p>
"Who are you, where do you come from?"
</p>

<p>
"You see, I am a tramp.  I walk about all over the
country but I do not remember where I come from."
</p>

<p>
"Is it true that you incite the mob to rebellion
and want to make the poor equal to the rich?"
</p>

<p>
"No, it is not true.  Rebellion is an evil thing, and
I want what is good."
</p>

<p>
"Why then don't you honour our gracious god-king?"
</p>

<p>
"I do honour the king, but the king is not God;
only one Man on earth shall be God."
</p>

<p>
"What man?"
</p>

<p>
"Men call him Osiris, but they do not know his
real name."
</p>

<p>
"Do you know it?"
</p>

<p>
"No, I don't know it either."
</p>

<p>
"And will <i>He</i> be like you?"
</p>

<p>
"No, the sun is not like the shadow."
</p>

<p>
"Is it he then who will make the rich and the
poor equal?"
</p>

<p>
"He, He alone and no one but He!  You have said
it well, my brother."
</p>

<p>
"I am not a brother to you, but a judge.  Don't
you know that I have the power to put you to death
or to pardon you?"
</p>

<p>
"Whether you put me to death or pardon me,
either will be a welcome gift to me," Bata answered
with such a serene smile that Usimar marvelled
more than ever and thought 'Poor crazy creature,
one can't be angry with him.'
</p>

<p>
He asked him many more questions, but could
not discover anything.  Usirmar was a just and
intelligent man: he understood that the denunciation
was for the most part untrue and wanted to pardon
the unfortunate prisoner, but could not do so legally;
he gave him a light sentence, however; a light
corporal punishment and then three years labour in the
Nubian gold mines.
</p>

<p>
The sentence was carried out.  With a number of
other convicts Bata was sent in a large flat-bottomed
barge, a floating prison, up the Nile to the
distant Elephant City, Ieb, in the South.  A caravan
route went from Ieb through the terrible desert of
Kush.  There in the mining wells in the burning
hot depths of the earth old and young men, women
and children, with chains on their naked bodies,
worked day and night under the overseer's whip,
grinding quartz on hand mills, washing gold sand,
and dying like flies of heat and thirst.
</p>

<p>
Issachar had escaped out of prison before the
trial.  The cunning sons of Israel bribed the gaolers
and helped him to run away.  Yubra escaped with
him.  They hired from a fisherman a sailing boat,
old and damaged but swift, and sailed up the Nile
following the prison barge at a distance.
</p>

<p>
They overtook and passed it by the City of the
Sun.  Issachar went ashore, found the chief of the
guards, Mahu, and told him that Akhnaton, King
of Egypt, was on the barge that was approaching
the city.
</p>

<p>
Knowing something about the king's sudden
disappearance, Mahu was not very much surprised, but
he did not believe Issachar at once.  Detaining him,
he promised to reward him if his words proved to be
true and, if not, to put him to death; he gave orders
to stop the barge and at nightfall went to the harbour
with fifty black soldiers on whose loyalty he could
rely.  Going on board he called the chief gaoler and
ordered him to bring the prisoner called Bata; he
took Bata into a deck cabin, shut the doors and
windows and bringing a lamp close to his face
recognised King Akhnaton.
</p>

<p>
"We guards are used to all sorts of things," Mahu
used to tell afterwards.  "We have seen so much
that our hearts are like stone.  But at that moment
my heart melted like wax!"
</p>

<p>
It would have been terrible to him to see a wretched
madman instead of King Akhnaton, Joy of the Sun;
but it was more terrible to find before him a happy
and rational man.
</p>

<p>
"Life, strength and health to the king," he began,
but his voice failed him, his knees gave way under
him and, falling at the king's feet, he wept.
</p>

<p>
The king bent down and said, putting his arms
round him:
</p>

<p>
"There, Mahu, don't cry.  I am happy here...."
</p>

<p>
And added, after a pause:
</p>

<p>
"I am better here than at home."
</p>

<p>
Mahu was still looking intently at him, hoping to
see a madman; but the king certainly was not mad,
and, all at once, Mahu felt as though he himself
were going out of his mind.
</p>

<p>
"What are you saying, what are you saying, sire?
You are better here among thieves and murderers
than among your faithful servants?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Mahu.  My brother, do you love me?  I
know you love me.  Do then what I ask you: tell
no one about me and let me go."
</p>

<p>
"God knows, Uaenra, I would gladly give my
soul for you, but it is easier for me to kill you
than leave you here."
</p>

<p>
"You will kill me if you don't leave me," the
king said, and again he bent down and, putting both
arms round Mahu's head, looked into his eyes with
entreaty.
</p>

<p>
Mahu said afterwards that in another minute he
would have broken down, lost his reason and gone,
leaving the king behind.  But Akhnaton had pity
on him.
</p>

<p>
"You cannot?" he whispered as though lost in
thought, looking at Mahu so that his heart again
melted like wax.  "Well, there is nothing for it
then, let us go!"
</p>

<p>
They went from the cabin on to the deck.  The
king stepped into a litter.  The soldiers lifted it and
carried him to the palace.

<p class="dropcap">
Dio woke up, opened her eyes and saw
that the dull gold of the palm
leaves on the capitals was turning
silver in the bluish light of the
morning, while the flickering flame
of the night-light still threw a
reddish reflection on the pale green, pointed leaves
at the bottom of the columns; in the middle, where
the disc of the god Aton was spreading its
hand-shaped rays over the royal couple, the two lights
merged in one.
</p>

<p>
Dio lay on a panther skin spread on the floor
between two beds; the queen slept in one, but the
king's bed was empty.  Dio raised her head and
looked at the sleeper: she slept quietly, breathed
evenly; only at times the fine brows twitched like
a butterfly's antennae and the wrinkle between them
grew deeper, as though she were thinking hard even
in her sleep; the pale face with the black shadow of
the long lashes was beautiful in spite of the ravages
wrought by disease.
</p>

<p>
Dio looked at the queen and it seemed to her it
was he and not she: the sister-wife was strikingly
like her brother-husband, especially in sleep.
</p>

<p>
Her hand, transparently pale with the blue veins
standing out, hung over the edge of the bed.  Dio
touched it with her lips as lightly as the night wind
and again it seemed to her it was not her hand but
his.
</p>

<p>
"The two are one," she thought.  "How could they
have parted?  How could he have left her?  What
will become of her, what will become of him?"
</p>

<p>
He had told the queen before his departure that
he was going to Horemheb, the Viceroy of the
North, to persuade him to accept the throne.  The
queen had always dreamed of resigning the throne
and being free from the heavy yoke of sovereignty.
She was glad and believed him, though not quite; she
was surprised at his not taking her with him: for so
many years they had hardly ever parted for a single
day, and now in those dreadful weeks after Maki's
death he left her, ran away as it were.  She felt he
was concealing something from her.  She soon
learned that he had never arrived at Memphis and
no one knew or wanted to tell her where he was.
She asked Dio, but she did not know either, or did
not want to tell.  Dio said nothing for days, but at
last, seeing that the torture of uncertainty was worse
than anything for the queen, she told her.
</p>

<p>
The queen listened to her calmly, as though she
had been prepared for it; she had submitted to him
in everything and she submitted to this, also.  But
she still failed to understand why he had not taken
her with him.  Together in happiness but apart in
sorrow: so then he did not love her as much as
she loved him?  But for this, too, she blamed herself:
she evidently had not known how to love; had she
loved him more this would not have happened.
</p>

<p>
That same day she took to her bed and did not
get up any more.  The heart disease she had had for
years grew very much worse.
</p>

<p>
Dio never left her for a moment: she remembered
her promise to the king.  But she sometimes fancied
that her love was worse than hatred.  She acted like
a skilled torturer who preserves his victim's life,
inflicting wounds and then healing them to prolong the
torture.  She deceived the queen from day to day,
telling her that they were looking for the king, would
soon find him, had already traced him; but each
deception was found out and the torture grew worse.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes she felt indignant on her account:
"What has he done to her!  He did not want to kill
the victim with his own hands&mdash;he ran away; he
took a light burden upon himself and put upon her
a burden no human being can bear."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
That night the invalid had a terrible heart attack.
The physician, Pentu, thought she would not survive
it.  The pang in her breast was so severe that she
turned blue as though she had been strangled.  No
drugs were of any help.  Finally Pentu decided to
try, as the last resort a very powerful and dangerous
remedy&mdash;the stupefying juice of Kidjevan belladonna,
Lybian sylphium, Arabian myrrh and poppy
juice with powdered turquoise and bones of the sacred
ibis.
</p>

<p>
The remedy helped: the invalid dropped asleep.
</p>

<p>
Would she wake?  "Oh, if only...." Dio thought
and broke off, remembering the king's words, "if
she dies, I will die with her."  She knew this would
be so.
</p>

<p>
The curtain on the door moved.  Dio turned round
and saw that Pentu had thrust his head in.  She got
up and went to speak to him behind the door in the
covered passage leading to the river.
</p>

<p>
The early morning sky, grey as though covered
with clouds, reminded her of the winter days when
wet snow fell on Mount Ida.  But the sun would rise
and the sky would be as blue and cloudless as ever.
White mist coiled like smoke over the low-lying
meadows beyond the river, a water-bird among the
reeds was calling in a creaking voice, and as though
in answer to it the wheel of a well creaked somewhere
in the distance.  There was a smell of bitter
smoke and winter freshness.
</p>

<p>
Pentu took Dio by the hand, led her away from
the door and whispered in her ear.
</p>

<p>
"The king has come back...."
</p>

<p>
"Where is he?" Dio cried.
</p>

<p>
Pentu silenced her with a gesture.
</p>

<p>
"Sh-sh!  She may hear.  We must prepare her;
if she heard suddenly it would be fatal...."
</p>

<p>
"Where is he?" Dio repeated in a whisper.
</p>

<p>
Pentu pointed to the door at the end of the
passage.  Dio rushed towards it, but stopped and put
her hands to her head.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Pentu, how are we to tell her?  I cannot,
you had better do it."
</p>

<p>
"No, Dio, you, no one but you!"
</p>

<p>
"Where did he come from?  How did they find him?"
</p>

<p>
"Mahu brought him, but I don't know where from."
</p>

<p>
"Have you seen him?"
</p>

<p>
"I have."
</p>

<p>
"Well, how is he, what does he look like?"
</p>

<p>
"Better not ask.  Such a thing hasn't happened
since the days of the god Ra!  In rags, unwashed,
unshaved, bristles on his face, thin, black with
sunburn and, dreadful to say, scars on his back.  But,
thanks to Mahu, no one except us knows anything
about it&mdash;he has managed it all splendidly!  We
washed, shaved and dressed him...."
</p>

<p>
He stopped, as though lost in thought and then
turned to Dio again.
</p>

<p>
"Well, why do you stand still?  Go to her and I
will keep watch here.  When the king heard she
was ill he rushed to her and we had difficulty to
hold him back....  Go, don't be afraid.  God willing,
everything will come right!"
</p>

<p>
Dio returned to the bedroom.  The queen was
lying with her eyes open.  She looked at Dio
intently.
</p>

<p>
"Where have you been?"
</p>

<p>
"Just by the door."
</p>

<p>
"Whom were you talking to?"
</p>

<p>
"To Pentu."
</p>

<p>
"What about?"
</p>

<p>
"About the king.  Good news...."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes, they are looking for him, they will
soon find him.  They have traced him already.  Oh,
Dio, aren't you tired of it?  It's a mean, silly game!
You know I was thinking last night that if I
loved him more I wouldn't suffer as I do.  He is not
a child and not insane&mdash;he knows what he is doing.
He has gone away&mdash;very well, it means it's better
for him it should be so.  Dio, my dear, my sister,
he loves you.  Be with him, love him to the end,
don't forsake him; if need be, die with him.  But
don't lie any more...."
</p>

<p>
She raised herself on her elbow and looked at Dio
still more intently.
</p>

<p>
"What is the matter with you?  Why do you tremble?"
</p>

<p>
"I am afraid.  I kept telling you lies and now when
I must tell the truth I don't know how to do it.
Do you know what Pentu and I were talking of
just now?  Of how best prepare you for joy...."
</p>

<p>
"What am I saying, good Lord!" she thought
with terror, but could not stop herself, it was like
rolling headlong downhill.
</p>

<p>
"What joy?" the queen whispered, and she too
began to tremble.
</p>

<p>
"Why, a messenger whom Mahu had sent to
Memphis has just returned; he had seen the king in
two days' journey from here: the king knows you
are ill and is coming home.  He may be here
to-morrow evening.  If you don't believe me, ask
Mahu...."
</p>

<p>
Watching the change in the queen's face, Dio felt
that she had found the right way, and, fearing no
longer, led her with a firm hand by the very edge
of the abyss; and she might have led her through
safely and saved her.  But suddenly a cry was
heard, distant at first and then nearer and nearer;
someone was running and shouting.  A door banged
close by.  Dio recognized the voice of Princess
Meritatona, who though still weak after her illness, was
no longer confined to her bed.  She must have heard
of the king's return and was running to him shouting:
"Abby!  Abby!  Abby!"
</p>

<p>
With a low exclamation the queen jumped off the
bed and ran to the door.  Dio held her back, but she
struggled, crying:
</p>

<p>
"Let me go!  Let me go!  Let me go!"
</p>

<p>
She wrenched herself free, rushed through the
door, pushed Pentu away, and ran towards the door
at the end of the covered passage; having guessed
the direction from Rita's voice.  But after taking a
few steps she fell on her knees and stretching out her
arms cried "Enra!" in such a voice that an old
fisherman mending his net in a boat some distance down
the river heard it and wondered "who can be screaming
in the palace as though they were being murdered?"
</p>

<p>
A door at the end of the passage was flung open
and, running out of it, the king rushed to the queen
who lay on the floor.
</p>

<p>
Kneeling down he bent over her and lifted her
up, passing one arm round her waist, and supporting
her head with the other.  He looked into her
face.  With a low moan she opened her eyes and
looked at him with a blissful smile, repeating:
</p>

<p>
"It's you!  It's you!"
</p>

<p>
Suddenly she trembled all over and struggled like
a fish on a hook.  Her head was thrown back and
he felt her body growing heavy.  He laid her on
the floor and, bending down, kissed her on the lips,
receiving her last breath in that kiss.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
That same evening the queen's body lay on the
bed in her chamber and all except the king and Dio
were weeping over her.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "I am thy sister who loved thee on earth,<br>
  No one has loved thee more than I."<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Dio recalled the wail of Isis.
</p>

<p>
The king took her by the hand and said, leading
her aside, "It's a good thing you don't cry."
</p>

<p>
Dio made no answer and only gazed at him.
</p>

<p>
"We mustn't cry," he went on, with a quiet,
fearful smile.  "It is better so."
</p>

<p>
"Better?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, better.  Now we are free.  Let us go to
Him together.  Will you?"
</p>

<p>
"No!" she wanted to cry out, but looking at him
she suddenly grasped that it was not he who was
speaking.  And it was not to him she replied with
a smile as quiet and fearful as his own:
</p>

<p>
"Let us go!"

know yourself, hired assassins, sent by Tuta, are all
over the city.  You remember Iserker's knife and
Merira's poison?  Of course I must protect you!
You are laughing again?"
</p>

<p>
"Forgive me, my friend.  You are no good at lies:
Ramose lying is like a hippopotamus catching a flea!
It isn't from assassins but from myself you are
trying to protect me.  Be frank, tell me what do you
want of me?"
</p>

<p>
"I have told you many times, Uaenra: you are
king&mdash;so be a king...."
</p>

<p>
"I am no longer king: I have resigned the throne."
</p>

<p>
"A king cannot resign when he has no heir.  And
Saakera is dead...."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, my dear brother!  Tell me how he died."
</p>

<p>
"He fell on the battlefield like a hero.  He led the
army of the god Ra against Tuta's rabble; when our
men lost heart he rushed forward and drew them all
after him with his battle cry&mdash;do you know which?
'Sun's Joy, Uaenra!'  He had a spear wound in the
stomach and suffered for hours.  He had lived without
God, but he died a believer.  'There is God, there
is,' he kept repeating before his death, and he spoke
of you&mdash;he was happy to be dying for you...."
</p>

<p>
"You were wounded in the same battle?"
</p>

<p>
"It's a mere scratch, not a wound.  But many brave
men have given their lives for you, sire...."
</p>

<p>
He paused gloomily.
</p>

<p>
"And do you know who has Amon's ring with
poison, your present to Saakera?" he spoke again,
smiling.  "Merira.  No sooner had Saakera breathed
his last than Merira sent envoys to me begging for
the ring in exchange for twenty war chariots and
ten prisoners."
</p>

<p>
"Did you give it?"
</p>

<p>
"No, I refused.  But the ring was stolen all the
same, by his men, I expect.  Let him keep it&mdash;poison
suits the snake.  He had poured out half into your
cup but the other is left for himself.  Perhaps there
will be enough for Tuta as well!"
</p>

<p>
He went on talking at length about the war and
rebellion, imploring the king to show himself to the
people, so as to deprive Tuta of his chief weapon&mdash;the
belief that the king was dead and he, Tuta, was
the only legitimate heir to the throne.  But the king
no longer listened, he paced rapidly up and down
the covered passage leading to the river, the very
one in which the queen had died a fortnight before.
</p>

<p>
Ramose was sitting in an armchair; he did not like
to sit in the king's presence, but Akhnaton pressed
him to do so, knowing that he had difficulty in
standing because of the wound in his leg.
</p>

<p>
Big clouds, white and round, were reflected in
the smooth surface of the river that had entered its
banks for the winter, and boats, with outspread
sails flitted like birds over the clouds.  An amber ray
of the afternoon sun fell upon an old painting on the
inner wall of the passage: a girl of twelve was giving
a boy of thirteen a half-open tulip to smell; there
was the timid languor of love in their graceful, as
it were dancing, movements, and in their childish
faces a sadness that was not childish.  It was a
portrait of the king and queen in their youth.
</p>

<p>
The king looked with strangely insensible surprise
at the little girl, thinking that at that very moment her
dead body was twisting and turning, like the burning
bark of a tree, in the heavy resinous perfumes of
the embalmers.  He recalled his own saying that 'a
corpse is worse than dung,' and began to tremble with
quiet laughter, that ran down his body like shivers or
like crackling sparks in a fur that is being smoothed
with the palm.
</p>

<p>
Tired of walking he sat down in an armchair
next to a small chess table that stood between
him and Ramose.  A knife lay on the table.  The
king took it out of its sheath and looked at the
silver pattern on the bronze blade&mdash;lions hunting
antelopes among the reeds.
</p>

<p>
"Whose knife is it?" Ramose asked.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know," the king answered.  "See how fine
and flexible it is&mdash;a Keftian 'willow leaf.'  It must
be Dio's....  What do you think, my friend, is a
knife dangerous in a madman's hands?"
</p>

<p>
"You keep joking, sire, and I am in no mood for
jokes."
</p>

<p>
"Joking?  No, not quite.  I sometimes fancy...."
</p>

<p>
He broke off.  Shivers again ran up and down his
body like crackling sparks in a fur.
</p>

<p>
"Well, what are we to do about an heir, Ramose?
You say there is not one, and I say there are two:
Horemheb and Tuta&mdash;choose whichever you like."
</p>

<p>
"Horemheb will not accept the crown while you
live, and Tuta is a thief, a murderer, a low born
cur...."
</p>

<p>
His breath failed him; turning purple and shaking
with fury, he brought out:
</p>

<p>
"Tuta&mdash;king of Egypt?  No, sire, this shall not
be so long as I live."
</p>

<p>
He got up.
</p>

<p>
"Are you going?" the king asked, getting up, too.
</p>

<p>
"I am going; there is nothing more to say."
</p>

<p>
"Wait.  There was something else I wanted....
Yes, I know.  Do what you think best, it is all the
same to me, choose whom you like, only let me go.
I cannot bear it any longer...."
</p>

<p>
His lips trembled, his face twitched like that of a
child ready to burst into tears and, before Ramose
had time to think, the king fell on his knees before
him.
</p>

<p>
"Let me go!  Let me go!  Let me go!" he wept,
wringing his hands.
</p>

<p>
If the earth had given way under his feet or
the sky had fallen upon him, Ramose would have
been less horror-stricken.
</p>

<p>
He quickly bent down to the king, lifted him up,
put him in a chair and himself fell at his feet:
</p>

<p>
"My king, my god, Sun's Joy, Sun's only Son,
all shall be as you wish!"
</p>

<p>
But the king was no longer listening; he had
turned away and was staring before him with fixed,
wide-open eyes.
</p>

<p>
"What is it, sire?" Ramose said gently touching
his hand.
</p>

<p>
The king started, slowly turned to him and looking
straight into his eyes said with a quiet smile:
</p>

<p>
"Do you know, Ramose, when they were beating
me with sticks in the Busiris court it was less
shameful than this."
</p>

<p>
He rose and taking the knife walked towards the
door.  Ramose rushed after him.
</p>

<p>
The king turned round and shouted: "Let me go!
Let me go!"
</p>

<p>
Freeing his hand he threatened Ramose with the
knife, but at the same moment, with a terrible
scream, fell on the floor at his feet, struggling in
a fit of epilepsy.
</p>

<p>
Ramose was a courageous man, and he had seen
men in a fit more than once.  He knew that in the
'sacred illness' men are possessed by god; but he
could never decide whether the king was possessed
by god or the devil, and only now as he looked at
him he decided it was by the devil.
</p>

<p>
"Help!  Help!" he cried, running away as though
driven by an unearthly terror.
</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">
As many were astonied at Him, His
visage was so marred more than
any man and his form more than
the sons of men."  Dio recalled
Issachar's prophecy when she looked
at the king in his illness.
</p>

<p>
The first fit was followed by a second and a third
one, the worst that he had ever had.  Pentu, the
physician, was afraid he would not live.  He
did live, but it was no joy either to himself or to
others: it was terrible to see the soul dying in a
living body.
</p>

<p>
The days and hours, however, were not all alike.
Sometimes as though waking from deep sleep or a
swoon, he understood everything and spoke so
rationally that those around him had hopes of his
complete recovery.  But then his mind was clouded
again.  He sat for hours on the floor in some dark
corner with his back to the wall and his legs stretched
out, looking into vacancy with eyes dim as a new-born
baby's; or slowly swaying his body to and fro,
he muttered something under his breath rapidly and
inarticulately as in delirium, laughing quietly, or
crying, or humming a song.  Or he repeated one
and the same word over and over again with
meaningless persistence.  But sometimes there was an
obscure meaning in these repetitions.
</p>

<p>
"Aton-Amon, Aton-Amon, Aton-Amon," he kept
repeating one day, making one word of the two, as
though on purpose: he had devoted his whole life
to dividing them and now he seemed to have
understood that it had not been worth while.
</p>

<p>
Or he asked himself with perplexity, as though
he had forgotten and were trying to remember:
</p>

<p>
"Who am I?  Who am I?  Who am I?"
</p>

<p>
And suddenly, turning to Dio, said with a perfect
understanding of what he was saying:
</p>

<p>
"Oh, if I only knew who I am, I should be saved!"
</p>

<p>
He often had visions of his mother Tiy, of his
wife, Nefertiti, of his daughter, Maki, and spoke to
them as though they were living.
</p>

<p>
He had a vision of Shiha, the eunuch, too: standing
by his side on the top of a pyramid, he heard the
laughter of innumerable crowds down below, saw the
face of Aton the Sun red with laughter in the sky
and covering his face with his hands repeated:
</p>

<p>
"Shame!  Shame!  Shame!"
</p>

<p>
But when a flash of consciousness lighted the
darkness of his clouded mind, he was wise once
more&mdash;wiser than he had ever been.
</p>

<p>
At first Dio rejoiced at these lucid intervals, but
she came to fear them: after them the darkness was
even more terrible; he suffered acutely each time that
madness closed in upon him.
</p>

<p>
"My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me!"
he cried out one day, repeating an old Babylonian
psalm.
</p>

<p>
And suddenly Dio felt in a way she had never
done before that it was He Himself, the Son Who
was to come.  She was terrified at the thought, but
the memory of it remained in her soul like a trace
of lightning.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
They moved the king to the Maru-Aton palace
where Princess Makitatona had died four months
before.
</p>

<p>
It was a three-storeyed building, high like a tower;
the bottom was of brick, the top, light and airy, of
cedar and cypress wood, trellis-worked, gilded and
painted like a jewel casket.  On hot days drops of
resin trickled down the match-boarded walls and the
palace was fragrant like a censer.
</p>

<p>
The flat roof had a carved railing all round it&mdash;a
row of Sun-serpents, with gold sun-discs on their
heads, their throats dilated with poison.  A fire was
perpetually burning upon an altar on the roof and,
on an alabaster column in front of it, the sun disc
of the god Aton made of <i>cham</i>, a mixture of gold
and silver, glittered in the sky like another sun.
</p>

<p>
As soon as the king felt better he went up on the
roof to pray.
</p>

<p>
On the tenth day of his illness there was such an
improvement in his health that Dio began to hope
again.
</p>

<p>
He went up to the roof in the evening, himself
chopped some sandalwood and put it on the altar,
and when a white pillar of smoke rose in the still
air he knelt down, and stretching his arms to the
hand-shaped rays of Aton's sun began to pray.
Standing beside him, Dio heard the words of an
ancient Babylonian psalm:
</p>

<p>
"Out of the depths have I cried unto Thee, O
Lord!  Hear my voice, let Thine ears be attentive to
the voice of my supplication and enter not into
judgment with Thy servant, for in Thy sight shall no
man living be justified.  The enemy has persecuted
my soul, has smitten my life down to the ground,
has made me to dwell in darkness as those that have
been long dead.  My spirit is overwhelmed within
me, my heart within me is desolate.  I stretch forth
my hands unto Thee; my soul thirsteth after Thee as
a thirsty land.  Hear me speedily, O Lord, for I am
Thy son!"
</p>

<p>
The sun had set behind the Lybian hills and in
the afterglow the sky seemed covered with feathers
of fire; the green of the palm groves had turned blue
and the mirror-like surface of the water, almost
invisible, like another sky, reflected exquisite opalescent
shades of white, blue, green, yellow and rose.
</p>

<p>
The day had not yet died in the west but the night
was already being born in the east: there, in a violet
velvety sky, a full moon was glowing, yellow as
though filled with honey.
</p>

<p>
When he had finished his prayer, the king rose,
looked round and said:
</p>

<p>
"How lovely it is, O Lord!"
</p>

<p>
Tears trembled in his voice.  Dio knew they were
tears of joy and yet she looked at him anxiously.
He smiled at her and gently drawing her towards
him put his cheek against hers, as he often did, with
a childish tenderness.
</p>

<p>
"Ma, Ma, how lovely it is!  Don't be afraid, I
am not raving, I know you are not Ma."
</p>

<p>
Ma was the Cretan goddess, the Great Mother of
gods and men.
</p>

<p>
And he added, after a pause:
</p>

<p>
"You and Nefertiti and Tiy, all three of you are
One....  Don't be afraid, all shall be well, I will
recover ... And if I don't, never mind, it will be
well, too: even in my madness I will praise reason,
the sun of suns!"
</p>

<p>
He sat down in a chair and Dio on the ground at
his feet.  Gently stroking her hair, he said:
</p>

<p>
"Yes, maybe I shall die in my madness; I shall
be cursed, rejected, mocked by men.  'Ah, you silly,
you have disgraced yourself before all the world,' as
Shiha, the eunuch, says.  And yet, I have been the
first to see Him Who is to come!  The first ray of
sunshine is on the top of the pyramid while the rest
of the earth is still in darkness: this is how His light
rests upon me ... Why are you crying, Dio?  Are
you afraid that He will not come?"
</p>

<p>
"No, I am not afraid, I know He will come.  If
you have, so will He....  But when, when?  Men
have waited for him for centuries and may have to
wait for centuries more!  And when He does come,
it will not be for us...."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, for us, too.  Do you remember, I said to
you 'Let us go to Him'?  And now I say we shall
not go to Him, but He will come to us!"
</p>

<p>
And suddenly he began muttering, as though in
delirium:
</p>

<p>
"Soon!  Soon!  Soon!"
</p>

<h3>
VII
</h3>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-t.png" width="126" height="126" alt="T">
</div>

<p class="dropcap">
Tutankhaton's troops were
approaching the City of the Sun.
</p>

<p>
Tuta had proclaimed throughout
Egypt that King Akhnaton and the
heir-apparent, Saakera, had been
killed by the traitor Ramose and
that he, Tuta, henceforth the only legitimate heir to
the throne, was going to put the regicides to death.
Troops loyal to Ramose met the rebels at the southern
frontier of Aton's province.  The issue of the battle
was doubtful.  The rebels retreated, but so did
Ramose.  The old leader understood that his cause was
lost; his soldiers were dispirited; disturbed by
rumours from the enemy camp, they did not know
with whom and for whose sake they were fighting or
who the real rebel was&mdash;Tuta or Ramose.  The only
way to silence these rumours was for the king to
show himself to the troops; but Ramose had hardly
any hope of this left.
</p>

<p>
All the same he retreated towards Akhetaton, so
as to give the final battle in the presence of the
king.  "Perhaps he will think better of it and refuse
to give up his kingdom to Tuta, the thief," Ramose
thought.
</p>

<p>
But there was unrest in the city, too.  Robber
bands of Tuta's followers had stopped the supply of
corn to Akhetaton.  There were hunger riots, first
among the prisoners of war and hired labourers,
numbers of whom had been employed in building
the new capital, then among the troops left for the
defence of the city and, finally, in the Jews'
Settlement.
</p>

<p>
Ramose came to Akhetaton on the first day of the
riots but did not venture to enter the town with his
untrustworthy troops, and Tuta, who was following
him, overstepped the holy boundary of Aton's province.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
About one o'clock in the morning, Mahu galloped
up from the city to the royal gardens of Maru Aton,
bringing nine war chariots, and gave orders to place
the best detachments of the palace guards so as to
defend Maru Aton from a double attack of Tuta's
army and rebels from the city.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Where is the king?" Mahu asked, running into
the ground floor hall of the palace.
</p>

<p>
"He is asleep," Pentu, the physician, answered,
glancing at Mahu in alarm: he looked terribly upset
and his head was bandaged: he had evidently been
wounded.
</p>

<p>
"Go and wake him," Mahu said.
</p>

<p>
"Wake a sick man in the middle of the night?"
</p>

<p>
"Make haste and go!"
</p>

<p>
"But what has happened?"
</p>

<p>
"Rebellion in the town.  The king must be saved."
</p>

<p>
Both ran up to the first storey where the king lay
asleep on a humble bed in a small panelled room that
had belonged to the princess's nurse, Asa.
</p>

<p>
They called Dio and sent her to the king.  Screening
the flame of the lamp with her palm, she went
on tiptoe into the king's room and stopped to look
at him from a distance.  He slept so sweetly that it
seemed a pity to wake him.  But recalling Mahu's
words 'life is dearer than sleep,' she went up to the
sleeper and, bending down, kissed him on the head.
</p>

<p>
He woke up and smiled, screwing up his eyes
at the light.
</p>

<p>
"What is it, Dio?  Sleep, I am well."
</p>

<p>
"No, Enra, we mustn't sleep, get up.  Mahu has
come and says he must see you."
</p>

<p>
"Mahu?  What for?" he asked, looking at her
attentively and half-rising from the couch.
</p>

<p>
"He will hear it at once in any case," she thought
and said:
</p>

<p>
"There is a riot in the town."
</p>

<p>
"And Tuta is coming with his army?" he guessed:
he must have heard something before.  "Why haven't
I been told sooner?  Though it is better so&mdash;all at
once."
</p>

<p>
He spoke calmly, and, as it were, thoughtfully.
</p>

<p>
"Where is Mahu?"
</p>

<p>
"Shall I call him?"
</p>

<p>
"No, I will come."
</p>

<p>
He began dressing.  Dio helped him: they were
not shy of each other.  He dressed without hurry.
</p>

<p>
"What is this?" he asked, seeing a glow in the
windows.
</p>

<p>
"There is a fire somewhere."
</p>

<p>
"Where?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know.  Mahu will tell."
</p>

<p>
They went into the next room.  From there the fire
in the town could be seen: the king's granaries, the
barracks, the palace and Aton's temple were burning.
</p>

<p>
Mahu approached the king and fell at his feet.
</p>

<p>
"Life, power, health to the king...."
</p>

<p>
He could not speak for tears.  The king bent down
and embraced him.
</p>

<p>
"What is it, Mahu?  Don't cry, all will be well.
Are you wounded?" he asked, seeing the bandage on
his head.
</p>

<p>
"O, sire, never mind me&mdash;we must save you!"
</p>

<p>
"Save me from what?"
</p>

<p>
Mahu briefly told him what had happened and
exclaimed, falling at his feet again:
</p>

<p>
"Come, come quickly!  The chariots are waiting
at the garden gates.  We shall manage somehow to
go through the desert to the river lower down,
where there are no ambushes, take boats and in
another five days be in the loyal provinces of the
North."
</p>

<p>
"Run away?" the king asked, as calmly as before.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sire," Mahu replied.  "Tuta's rabble may be
here any minute.  I can't answer for your life."
</p>

<p>
"No, my friend, I cannot.  If I run away, what will
happen here, in the holy province of Aton?  Endless
war because of me!  I have begun with peace and I
shall end with war?  I say one thing and do another?
No, I have had enough of this shame.  And from
whom should I run away?  From Tuta?  But what
can he do to me?  Take away my kingdom?  Why,
this is just what I wish.  From the rebels?  And
what will they do to me?  Kill me?  Let them&mdash;death
is better than shame.  Ankh-em-maat, He-who-lives-in-truth,
is to die in falsehood?  No, in death I shall
say what I have said all my life: let there be
peace...."
</p>

<p>
He stopped suddenly and listened; the blast of
trumpets and the beat of drums were heard in the
distance.  There was a panic in the palace and in
the gardens.
</p>

<p>
The centurion of the Hittite amazons, the king's
bodyguard, ran up the stairs shouting:
</p>

<p>
"Tuta's soldiers are here!"
</p>

<p>
"Where?" Mahu asked.
</p>

<p>
"At the garden gates.  The fighting has begun."
</p>

<p>
All, except the king and Dio, ran downstairs.
</p>

<p>
The fierce noises of war invaded the quiet Maru-Aton
gardens: the blast of the trumpets, the beat of
the drums, the neighing of horses, the creaking of
carts, the rumble of chariots, the cries of the
chieftains.  Torches glowed in the black shadow of the
palm groves: the moonlit sky was red with the
dancing flames of the fire that made the face of the
moon look pale and crimsoned the gold disc of Aton
above the altar on the temple roof.
</p>

<p>
The gardens were surrounded by a quadrangle of
high, thick walls, like a fortress, with only one
gateway that gave on the river; an inner wall divided
the enclosure into two: stables, cellars, granaries and
barracks of the palace guards were in the southern
half while the northern was occupied with summer
houses, shelters, chapels of the god Aton and the
palace by the big artificial pond.
</p>

<p>
The vanguard of Tuta's troops stopped on reaching
Maru-Aton.  Knowing how many treasures it
held they wanted to plunder it.
</p>

<p>
They tried to force the gates.  Mahu's soldiers
repulsed them every time.  But reinforcements came to
the enemy continually and the rebels from the town
joined them.  They surrounded the garden, besieging
it like a fortress and, at last, forced their way in.
</p>

<p>
The battle was now fought at the inner wall.  The
half-savage mercenaries from the north&mdash;Achaeans
and Trojans&mdash;fought like lions.  Naked but for brass
leggings and brass plumed helmets, they flung small
round shields behind their backs and fought
desperately with the triangular iron sword-knife, one in
each hand.  Overcome by superior numbers they
retreated to the pond.  The water in it was shallow and
only reached to the men's waists.  The battle
continued in the water so fiercely that it became clouded
and warm with the blood.
</p>

<p>
Eteocles, the youthful leader of the Achaeans, was
dying on the bank under Maki's withered birch tree
and as he looked at its white stem he saw through
the darkness of death his far-off native land.
</p>

<p>
Some were fighting and others plundering.
</p>

<p>
The tender stalks of the flowers in the beds broke
under the soldiers' heavy tread.  There were pools of
blood on the floor of the chapel.  The wood of the
sacred pillars was chopped for bonfires, the purple
of the sacred curtains was torn to make leg wrappings;
the gold was scraped off the walls with fingernails.
An old woman from the Jewish settlement,
seeing that a precious casket had been screwed into
the floor and could not be carried away, bit at it so
hard that she secured a pearl with her teeth.
</p>

<p>
Naaman, the prophet, also from the Jews' Settlement,
was stamping on a gilded wooden disc of
Aton&mdash;a gold one would not have been given even
to a prophet&mdash;dancing and shouting.
</p>

<p>
"God of vengeance, Lord God of vengeance, show
Thyself!  Arise, judge of the earth, and judge the
proud!"
</p>

<p>
Cellars were broken into.  They were so flooded
with wine that people went down on their hands
and knees and lapped it up.  People drank themselves
to death.  Two drunken men had a fight and falling
to the bottom of the cellar were drowned in the
wine.
</p>

<p>
The screams of women and the blood of murdered
children formed a ghastly tribute to their respective
gods&mdash;Aton, Amon or Jahve.
</p>

<p>
The Sun's garden, God's paradise, was turned into
hell.
</p>

<p>
A handful of Achaeans and Trojans, who had not
been massacred in the pond, retreated towards the
palace that stood in the narrow part between the
pond and the north wall of the garden.  The palace
was defended by Mahu's war-chariots, the black
archers, Lycian slingers and Hittite Amazons.
</p>

<p>
Hearing that the king was in the palace, Tuta's
soldiers attacked it: they wanted to take the king,
dead or alive, so as to end the war.
</p>

<p>
At the same time Tutankhaton's main forces were
approaching from the south and Ramose's troops
from the north.  The great battle that was to decide
the destinies of Egypt began under the very walls of
Maru Aton.  It looked phantom-like in the darkness
of the night, the white moonlight and the red glow
of the conflagration.  The blast of the trumpets, the
beat of the drums, the neighing of horses, the rumble
of chariots, the clashing of swords, the whistling of
arrows, the moans of the dying and the cries of the
victors were all mingled in one seething hell.  And
the centre of it, the fixed axis in the whirling
hurricane of the war, was the quiet palace tower.
</p>

<p>
The king and Dio were looking down from its flat
roof.
</p>

<p>
"It's all because of me!" he repeated, wringing his
hands, or, stretching them out to the combatants,
he cried with desperate entreaty.
</p>

<p>
"Peace!  Peace!  Peace!"
</p>

<p>
It was as though he still hoped that men would
hear him and stop fighting.
</p>

<p>
Or he stopped up his ears, covered his face with
his hands, so as not to hear, not to see; or, running
up to the roof bannisters, bent down and looked
greedily at people dying and killing with his name on
their lips, and there was such anguish in his face that
it seemed as though every sword and spear and arrow
pierced his heart as its aim.  Or he ran to the
staircase door that had been locked, banged it with his
fists, and knocked his head against it, shouting:
</p>

<p>
"Open!"
</p>

<p>
And when Dio tried to restrain him he struggled
out of her arms and begged her, with tears:
</p>

<p>
"Let me go to them!"
</p>

<p>
She knew he wanted to throw himself among the
combatants so that they should kill him and stop
killing one another.
</p>

<p>
Now and again he suddenly grew quiet and sat
down on the floor, muttering something under his
breath, quickly and inaudibly, as in delirium.
Listening attentively, Dio caught once the words of the
incantation the old nurse Asa had said over the dying
Princess Maki:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Mother Isis calls<br>
  From the top of the hill,<br>
  Horus, my son,<br>
  The hill is on fire,<br>
  Bring me water,<br>
  Quench the fire!"<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"He will die insane," Dio thought, and sitting
next to him on the floor, she gently stroked his head
and whispered: "My poor little boy!  My poor little
boy!"
</p>

<p>
Listening to the roaring laughter of war, seeing
the sun disc of Aton turn red as though filled with
blood, she thought: "Perhaps we were mistaken after
all and God is not Love but Hate and the law of the
world is not peace, but war?"
</p>

<p>
Time ceased to exist, it was eternity: there always
had been, was, and would be this seething hell of war
to the furthest ends of the earth from the beginning
to the end of time.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Bring me water.<br>
  Quench the fire!"<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
No, no water would quench it and they would burn
in it for ever and ever.
</p>

<p>
"My poor little boy!" she kept whispering as she
stroked his head and suddenly she added, with
despairing tenderness: "My poor little girl!"
</p>

<p>
"Here I, too, am going mad," she thought.  They
both smiled&mdash;they understood each other&mdash;and there
was exquisite joy in this in spite of all the pain.
</p>

<p>
She saw blood on his face: he must have been
wounded with an arrow when he looked at the
battle leaning over the parapet; he had not felt it
and she had not noticed it.  She wiped off the blood
with the edge of her dress, but a trace of it still
remained.
</p>

<p>
Gazing at him she recalled the prophecy: "As
many were astonied at Him; his visage was so
marred more than any man, and his form more than
the sons of men."
</p>

<p>
"You are He!  You are He!" she whispered, with
joyous terror.
</p>

<p>
"No, Dio, I am only His shadow," he answered,
calmly and rationally.  "But if His shadow suffers
such agony, what will His suffering be?"
</p>

<p>
Suddenly he raised his eyes to the sky and jumped up.
</p>

<p>
"He is coming!" he cried in a voice so changed
and with his face so altered, that she thought he
would fall down in a fit.  But she, too, looked at the
sky and understood.
</p>

<p>
A gigantic, pyramid shaped ray, with its base
on the ground and its apex in the zenith, flashed in
the greyish sky of the morning, above the dying
glow of the city fire, and the white opalescent
lightnings of zodiacal light danced and quivered in it.
</p>

<p>
"Quick!  Quick!" he repeated, trembling like those
tremulous lights in the heavens.
</p>

<p>
They both made haste as though they were indeed
meeting the Unexpected One.
</p>

<p>
Blowing up the embers on the altar the king put
on them splinters of sandalwood and cannacat.  Lighting
a long golden censer, shaped like an outstretched
hand, Dio gave it to the king and herself took a
cithern&mdash;a brass hoop, threaded with fine silver
snakes that gave a high ringing sound.  Both stood
before the altar facing each other:
</p>

<p>
"I come to glorify Thy rays, living Aton, one
and eternal God!" he intoned, and it seemed to her
that his voice drowned the roaring laughter of the
hell let loose.
</p>

<p>
"Praise be to the living Aton, who didst create
the heavens and the secrets thereof!  Thou art in the
sky and Thy beloved son, Akhnaton, is on earth!"
she replied.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly the sound of axes came from below.
The building trembled as though it were going to
fall; the enemy had rushed into the palace and the
battle was being fought indoors.
</p>

<p>
"Fire!" someone shouted on the stairs and the
cry re-echoed, with a familiar dread, in Dio's heart:
she remembered how she had lain on the pyre, a
victim ready to be slain.  She rushed to the bannisters,
leaned over, and in the breach of the garden
wall saw Tutankhaton, the conqueror, in his chariot,
wearing the royal helmet with the royal serpent over
the forehead.
</p>

<p>
He saw her also and shouted to her, waving his
hands.  She did not hear the words, but understood
that he wanted to save her and was calling to her to
come down.
</p>

<p>
A black warrior, agile as a monkey, climbed to
the top of a palm by the roof of the lodge and cleverly
threw from there right at Dio's feet a rope-ladder.
Hardly knowing what she was doing, she picked it
up, fixed one end of it to the bannisters and let
the other down.
</p>

<p>
It would have been quite easy for her who had
tamed wild bulls on the Knossos arena to take the
king in her arms and carry him down&mdash;he was thin
as a skeleton and no heavier than a child.
</p>

<p>
But she stopped to think.  She leaned over the
bannisters once more and looked down.  Tuta went
on shouting and waving to her.  She looked into his
face: it was neither ill-natured nor kind; neither
stupid nor intelligent: the everlasting mediocre face
of the average man.
</p>

<p>
"Akhnaton will disappear, Tutankhaton will remain
and the kingdom of this world shall be Tuta's
kingdom," she recalled the saying and thought
"Should I spit into that face?  No, it isn't worth
while."
</p>

<p>
She threw the ladder into the fire&mdash;the bottom
storey was in flames already&mdash;and returned to the
king.
</p>

<p>
Hearing and seeing nothing, he stood on the same
spot stretching out his hands to the rising sun.
</p>

<p>
"O Lord, before the foundations of the earth were
laid Thou didst reveal Thy will to Thy Son Who
lives for ever.  Thou, Father, art in my heart and
no one knows Thee, but me, Thy son!"
</p>

<p>
With furious roaring laughter red tongues of
flame shot up on all sides through the white coils of
smoke, as though the hell let loose had leapt up to
heaven.
</p>

<p>
Dio rushed to the king, looked into his face that
was like the sun and recognized Him Who was
to come.
</p>

<p>
"Is it Thee, O Lord?"
</p>

<p>
"It is I!"
</p>

<p>
He embraced her as a bridegroom embraces a
bride and in a fiery storm of love raised her to the
Father.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The palace, a light trellis-work structure of cedar
and cyprus-wood, dry and resinous, burned like a
candle and its fragrant smoke coiled like incense upon
an altar to greet the rising sun.
</p>

<p>
But when the sun rose it shone upon a smoking
black ruin&mdash;the tomb of Akhnaton and Dio.
</p>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-t.png" width="126" height="126" alt="T">
</div>

<p class="dropcap">
Tutankhaton was king of Egypt.
On his accession to the throne he
changed his name from Tutankhaton&mdash;the
living image of Aton&mdash;to
Tutankhamon&mdash;the living image of
Amon.  He changed his religion
just as easily.  He took off his feet Amon's sandals
with the divine image on the soles and bowed down
before the god on whom he had trampled.
</p>

<p>
He moved from the City of the Sun to the ancient
capital, Thebes, and began restoring Amon's temples
throughout Egypt: he raised up idols of pure gold to
him, multiplied gifts and levys, re-established feasts
and sacrifices.  He demolished the temples of Aton
and destroyed his name wherever it was found&mdash;on
granite colossi or personal amulets, on the high
obelisks or in underground tombs.  The same masons
were hammering with their mallets as in King
Akhnaton's reign: then they had been destroying the
name of Amon and now the name of Aton; the same
spies who had then been tracking Amon's secret
worshippers were now hunting down the servants
of Aton.
</p>

<p>
King Akhnaton's memory was anathematized.
The curse was proclaimed throughout Egypt:
</p>

<p>
"May the Lord destroy the memory of him in
the land of the living and may his double, Ka, find
no rest in the kingdom of the dead.  Woe to thine
enemies, Lord, their dwelling-place is in darkness,
but the rest of the earth in thy light.  The sun of
them that hate thee is darkened, the sun of them that
love thee is rising!"
</p>

<p>
No one dared to mention his name and he was
called the Enemy, the Criminal, the Monster, or the
Buffoon, the Fool.
</p>

<p>
The first men of the land&mdash;the well-born, the rich,
the happy, soon forgot him; but the last&mdash;the
beggars, the sick, the wretched remembered him for
years.  They did not believe in his death: "he died
and rose from the dead," said some of them, while
others asserted that he did not die at all, but escaped
from the palace and wandered about the world as a
beggar, secretly.  But all equally believed that he
would come again and restore truth and justice;
would punish the wicked, show mercy to the good,
comfort the sorrowful, free the slaves, make the
poor and the rich equal, wipe out the field boundaries,
like the Nile, with the waters of inexhaustible
love; would save the world that was perishing in
evil and be the second Osiris, the true Redeemer
and Son.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Do you know what rumours there are about?"
Tuta said one day to Merira, the high priest of
Amon, and his chief helper in the war upon
Aton.
</p>

<p>
"What rumours, sire?"
</p>

<p>
"That the Criminal is alive."
</p>

<p>
"I have known it all along," Merira answered,
with a smile so strange that Tuta was surprised,
almost alarmed.
</p>

<p>
"Known what?"
</p>

<p>
"That he is alive.  He may die any number of
times, but the Fool will always live for the fools!
Foolishness is the sun of the world, and he, Uaenra,
is the son of the Sun."
</p>

<p>
Tuta laughed and was reassured.  But then he
sighed and added sadly:
</p>

<p>
"Yes, my friend, foolishness is immortal.  It is
hard to combat it&mdash;harder than we had thought."
</p>

<p>
They spoke of other things.  But in the middle
of the conversation Merira asked as though
recalling something:
</p>

<p>
"Do you know for certain, sire, that Akhnaton is
dead?"
</p>

<p>
Tuta thought at first he was still joking, but,
looking attentively into his face, was again surprised,
almost frightened.
</p>

<p>
"How can you ask, my friend?  Why, how could
I not be certain when I saw with my own eyes...."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, you must have excellent eyes: it is not easy
to see from the battlefield and recognise a man's
face at the top of a house in the night, through
thickets of trees, smoke and flame!"
</p>

<p>
"But not I alone, everyone says he was there and
Dio with him, and I certainly did see her."
</p>

<p>
"You saw her, but did you see him?"
</p>

<p>
"I think I did."
</p>

<p>
"You think&mdash;that means you are not certain."
</p>

<p>
"Come, Merira, can you really think?&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I don't think anything, sire, I only want to know."
</p>

<p>
They looked at each other in silence and both
felt uncomfortable.  Again they spoke of other
things.  And when Merira rose to go, Tuta asked
him:
</p>

<p>
"How is your health?"
</p>

<p>
"I am well, why?"
</p>

<p>
"You don't look well, you have grown much
thinner in the face."
</p>

<p>
"I must be tired of waging war upon the Fool,"
Merira answered, with the same queer smile as
before.
</p>

<p>
Tuta was holding his hand affectionately and
looking into his eyes, as though he wanted to say
something more, but did not venture to do so.  Merira
was silent also.
</p>

<p>
"And do you know where these rumours come
from, about the Criminal being alive?" Tuta said
at last.  "From that accursed hole, the City of the
Sun, damnation take it!  Our friend Panehesy is
still hiding there like a scorpion in a chink&mdash;there
is no catching him...."
</p>

<p>
Panehesy, the second priest of Aton, a mild
fanatic, a 'holy fool,' in Ay's words, was one of the
few people who had remained faithful to King
Akhnaton.
</p>

<p>
"And it is not only he," Tuta continued.  "All
sorts of rascals keep going there.  Living fools do
their best for the dead, spreading seditious rumours
among the people...."
</p>

<p>
He paused and said, after a moment's thought:
</p>

<p>
"Do me the favour, my friend, go to the City and
find out what is going on there; I have long meant
to ask you.  That wasps' nest ought to be destroyed
and burnt down utterly!"
</p>

<p>
"No, sire, spare me.  You have spies enough and
I am not any good at that kind of thing," Merira
replied so drily that Tuta did not insist.
</p>

<p>
But two days later Merira returned to the subject
himself and suddenly said that he was ready to go.
Tuta was overjoyed and at once sent him on the
journey, with a whole pack of spies, an assembly
of priests and a strong detachment of bodyguards.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The City of the Sun was deserted.  Several times
during the war the rebellious mob and Tuta's troops
burned and plundered it.  And when the new king
ascended the throne he ordered that it should be
destroyed completely and the inhabitants driven out.
At first they had to be driven out by force and,
afterwards, they fled of their own accord from the
accursed place where nothing but ruins remained.
</p>

<p>
The royal gardens of Maru-Aton were even more
desolate than the city.  Their walls were destroyed
and waves of drifting sand covered the burnt-out
flower beds, the dried-up ponds, the fallen trees and
the charred remains of the lodges, arbours and
chapels.  The place that had once been God's
paradise was now a desert.
</p>

<p>
Some three days after his arrival in the town
Merira visited Maru-Aton gardens to see the spot
where the Criminal perished.
</p>

<p>
It was the month of Paonzu, March&mdash;already hot
summer in Egypt.  The sun had just set and the
Lybian hills stood out black and flat, like the charred
edge of a papyrus against the red sky.  The Nile,
too, seemed black and heavy, streaked with red here
and there.  The sail of a boat looked like a
blood-stained rag against its dark surface.
</p>

<p>
The breath of the wind was hot as that of a man
in a fever; the evening had brought it neither
freshness nor rest.  The grasshoppers chirped like dry
sticks crackling in the fire; felled palms, lying on
the ground, rustled with their yellow leaves as the
sand dropped from them on the ground.
</p>

<p>
A shepherd's pipe wailed in the distance; monotonously
sad, the sounds fell slowly one after the other
like tear after tear.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "The wail is raised for Tatmmiz far away.<br>
  The mother-goat and the kid are slain,<br>
  The mother sheep and the lamb are slain,<br>
  The wail is raised for the beloved Son."<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
The old shepherd was Engur, son of Nurdahan, a
Babylonian slave of Tammuzadad, brought by Dio
to Egypt from the island of Crete.
</p>

<p>
As he drove up to Maru-Aton Merira saw Engur's
lean sheep and goats nibbling the dry grass on the
hills.  "It must be he singing," Merira guessed,
listening to the sounds of the pipe.  He knew the
song: he had heard it once together with Dio and
she translated the Babylonian words into Egyptian
for him.  He recalled them now: "The wail is
raised for the beloved Son!"
</p>

<p>
"It's always about Him, there is no getting away
from Him," he thought drearily, frowning with
disgust.
</p>

<p>
A young priest, Horus, a pupil of Ptamose, was
walking beside him.  He was the young man with
the austere and meagre face whom Dio had seen
once in the subterranean sanctuary of the god Ram.
He was telling Merira about the rebels who had just
been arrested as secret worshippers of the Criminal&mdash;the
king's dwarf, Iagu, the runaway slave, Yubra,
old Zenra, Dio's nurse, and other poor and obscure
people.  He hoped to trace through them Issachar
and Aton's priest Panehesy, the two chief rebels.
</p>

<p>
"Have you questioned them?" Merira asked.
</p>

<p>
"I have."
</p>

<p>
"What do they say?"
</p>

<p>
"That the Criminal is alive."
</p>

<p>
"How could they believe anything so absurd?"
</p>

<p>
"They say they have seen him."
</p>

<p>
"Where, when, how?"
</p>

<p>
"They would rather die than say."
</p>

<p>
"What are you going to do with them?"
</p>

<p>
"Whatever you tell me, father."
</p>

<p>
"It is all one to me, but remember: if you put
the living fools to death the dead one will be alive
all the more.  I should release them all and make
an end of it."
</p>

<p>
"As you like, master, but what will the king say?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh yes, the king.  You want to please the king?
Very well, do what you like, only don't talk to me
about it....  What day is it?"
</p>

<p>
"The twenty-fourth of Paonzu."
</p>

<p>
"And when did King Akhnaton die?"
</p>

<p>
"On the twenty-fifth."
</p>

<p>
"What a coincidence!"
</p>

<p>
"How do you mean?" Horus asked him, with
sudden alarm.
</p>

<p>
Merira made no answer and stopped to look round.
</p>

<p>
"Where have you brought me, my friend?  A
cheerful sort of place!"
</p>

<p>
The burning sky was a deep red, the breath of
the wind was hot and feverish, the yellow palm leaves
made a dry rustle as the sand dropped from them
on the ground, the crickets chirped and the pipe
wailed.
</p>

<p>
"Always about Him&mdash;there is no getting away
from Him!" Merira thought again, drearily.  He
sat down heavily on a tree-trunk on the ground,
stretched himself, raising his arms above his head
and yawned convulsively like a man who had not
slept for several nights.
</p>

<p>
"How dreary it all is, oh dear!" he said, as he
yawned.  "Don't you find it dreary, Horus?"
</p>

<p>
"Find what dreary, father?"
</p>

<p>
"Everything, my friend, everything: being born,
living, dying and rising from the dead.  It would
not be so bad if there were something new there,
but what if it is the same as here&mdash;everlasting
dreariness!"
</p>

<p>
He suddenly raised his eyes to Horus and laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Why, my son, you seem to have two little lumps
on your forehead!  That's a strange thing.  You
have grown horns just like a little ram.  Bend down,
let me feel them."
</p>

<p>
Horus was frightened.  He knew that Merira was
seriously ill and knew what his complaint was, but
he feared to think of it.  He always hoped that God
would have mercy and spare the great prophet who
had saved the earth from the Criminal.
</p>

<p>
He stood more dead than alive.  But so strong
was the habit of obeying the master that at the
words 'bend down,' he submissively bent his shaven
head.  Merira gently moved his palm over it and
again a smile that was like a grimace of disgust
appeared on his face.
</p>

<p>
"No, there's nothing, it is smooth....  But why
are you so frightened, you foolish boy?  Come, I
was joking, I wanted to test you.  You keep watching
me, afraid I will go mad.  But I won't, don't
you fear.  I have only grown rather foolish through
my war with the Fool, but it will soon pass off...."
</p>

<p>
Horus bent down again, seized his hand and
kissed it.  "If he dies, I will die with him," he
thought and calmed down.
</p>

<p>
"I know you love me, dear boy," Merira said,
kissing him on the head.  "There, that's enough
talking, let us go.  Where is the place of the fire?"
</p>

<p>
Walking a few steps they came to a sandy open
space&mdash;the big pond.  Beside it, Maki's birch tree,
buried in the sand, showed a bit of the broken white
stem.
</p>

<p>
As he passed it, Merira for some reason recalled
Dio, and he suddenly wanted to kiss the white slender
stem, rosy in the light of the setting sun.  But he
felt shy of Horus: the young man might again
imagine something.  He merely slowed his pace
and touched the stem as though it were a living hand
stretched out to him from the earth, and for the
first time after many days he smiled a real and not
a jeering smile.
</p>

<p>
Passing the pond they came to a small sandy hillock,
with charred planks and beams sticking out
here and there.  These were the ruins of the burnt
palace&mdash;the tomb of Akhnaton and Dio.
</p>

<p>
"Was it here he perished?" Merira asked.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," Horus replied.  "This is a holy place to
them: they come here to worship the Criminal."
</p>

<p>
On the top of the hill two charred cross-beams,
with a brass hoop at the top&mdash;probably a bolt that
had been curled in the fire&mdash;stood out clearly against
the red evening sky, like the hieroglyphic of life, the
looped cross Ankh.
</p>

<p>
"What is this?  Did it happen of itself in the
fire?" Merira asked, pointing to it.
</p>

<p>
"No, the Criminal's worshippers must have made
it," Horus answered, and calling one of the soldiers
of the bodyguard, who were standing by the hillock,
he told him to take away the cross.
</p>

<p>
The man climbed up, drew the poles out of the
sand, broke them and flinging them on the ground,
trampled upon them.
</p>

<p>
"He is alive, alive, alive!  He was dead and behold
he is alive!"  Merira heard a loud voice behind
him and, turning round, saw a thin ragged man,
blackened by the sun and shaggy like a wild beast,
walking towards him with a distorted face and
fiercely burning eyes.
</p>

<p>
"I know what you have come for, murderer!" he
cried, like one possessed.  "You want to kill the
dead, but behold he is alive and you are dead!"
</p>

<p>
At a sign from Horus the soldiers seized the man.
</p>

<p>
"Let him go," Merira commanded, and turning
to the man asked him:
</p>

<p>
"Who are you?"
</p>

<p>
"Don't you recognise me?  And yet we are old
friends, berries from the same vine.  We both are
his murderers&mdash;only I have grown wiser and you
are still foolish!"
</p>

<p>
Merira looked at him and recognized Issachar the
Jew.
</p>

<p>
"Thus speaks the Lord God of Israel," Issachar
cried again, lifting up his hands.  "They shall look
upon Him Whom they have pierced and they shall
mourn for Him as one mourneth for his only son,
and shall be in bitterness for him as one is in
bitterness for his firstborn!"
</p>

<p>
And as though in answer to the cry the shepherd's
pipe wailed:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Dead is the Lord, dead is Tammuz!<br>
  Dogs wander about in the ruined house,<br>
  Ravens flock to his funeral feast.<br>
  O heart of the Lord!  O pierced side!"<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Merira walked up to Issachar, took him by the
hand, led him aside, and said:
</p>

<p>
"Stop shouting and tell me plainly what do you
want of me?"
</p>

<p>
"Don't you know?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't."
</p>

<p>
"Then I won't tell you: you wouldn't believe me
if I did.  He will tell you himself."
</p>

<p>
Merira understood that 'he' meant King Akhnaton.
</p>

<p>
"Thine hour is at hand, Merira.  To-morrow is
a great day, do you know what it is?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, the day of the Fool's death."
</p>

<p>
"Mind you don't find yourself among the fools,
you clever one!" Issachar said, turning to go.
</p>

<p>
At a sign from Horus the soldiers again ran up
and seized him, but Merira said once more:
</p>

<p>
"Let him go, don't interfere with him!"
</p>

<p>
The soldiers released him, and he went without
quickening his pace or turning round, as though
certain of not being touched again.
</p>

<p>
"Are you going to let him off, father?" Horus
asked Merira.  "This is Issachar, the Jew, their
prophet, the chief rebel," he added, thinking that
Merira had not recognised him.
</p>

<p>
"But what are we to do with him?  You see he is
crazy, nothing is to be gained from him!" Merira
answered, shrugging his shoulders, and went to
where his chariot was waiting for him.  He stepped
into it and drove into the town.

</div>

<p class="dropcap">
Merira was staying in Tuta's house,
which had, at the king's orders,
been preserved for the benefit of
posterity.  Merira lived in the
summer house by himself, Horus
and the other priests were in the
winter house and the soldiers in the outbuildings.
</p>

<p>
Returning to the town after dark Merira called
on Horus and told him to have everything ready in
the upper Aton's temple at daybreak for a service to
Amon and laying a curse upon the Criminal.
</p>

<p>
Then he went indoors to the upper chamber, where
the conspirators' meeting had once been held, and
lay down on the couch.  He lay there with his eyes
closed, his face still as death; he did not sleep and
knew he would not.
</p>

<p>
Late at night he got up and sniffed the air with
a grimace of disgust.  His old illness was upon him
again: he was everywhere pursued by bad smells&mdash;of
dead rats, as in a granary, of bats' dirt as in the
tombs, of rotten fish as on the banks of the Nile,
where fish is cleaned, salted and dried in the sun.
He opened a box at the head of the bed and taking
out a gold casket, with white powder in it, sniffed
it, put some on his tongue and spat it out.  He
knew the powder would make him sleep but afterwards
sleeplessness would be worse than ever.
</p>

<p>
He placed the casket back in the box and took out
the ring with the carbuncle&mdash;Amon's eye.  He lifted
the stone which turned on a tiny golden hinge and
peeped into the cavity underneath, filled with silvery
grey powder&mdash;the poison.  Only a half of it remained,
the other he had put into the king's cup at
Saakera's feast.  Moving the stone into its place he
put the ring back into the box.
</p>

<p>
He went down into the garden and then through
a gate in the garden wall into the street, bathed in
the white moonlight on one side and black with the
shadows of the ruins on the other.
</p>

<p>
He stooped as he walked with his head bent, treading
heavily and leaning on a staff, like a weary
pilgrim at the end of a day's journey.
</p>

<p>
Clouds, fluffy like lambs, with transparent opalescent
fleece, tawny-pink and silvery-blue in the moonlight,
slowly moved all in one direction as though
grazing in the pastures of heaven, with the moon for
shepherd.  There was stillness in heaven and
stillness on earth; nothing stirred, as though bound by
the moon's silver chains; only bats flitted to and
fro like shuttles in a loom.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly there came the sound of howling and
laughter as though someone, tickled to the point of
tears, were both laughing and weeping.  It was
the howling of hyenas that must have scented
Merira.  It was followed by the hysterical barking
of jackals.  The dead city came to life.  But gradually
they subsided and stillness reigned once more.
</p>

<p>
Passing a huge piece of waste ground with charred
planks and beams&mdash;remnants of the king's palace,
Merira came to Aton's temple.
</p>

<p>
Most of the temple had remained.  The huge
building, with thick walls of well-baked brick and
stone, could not be burned and was not easy to
demolish.  Only wooden rafters in the ceilings had been
burned and ceilings and columns had fallen down
in places.  All bas-reliefs of King Akhnaton
sacrificing to the god of the Sun had been broken and
hieroglyphic inscriptions painted over or erased.
The three hundred and sixty-five alabaster altars,
in the seven courts of the temple, had also been
destroyed and their place defiled: cartloads of filth
had been brought from the Jews' Settlement and
flung there, so that for a time the stench took one's
breath away.  But soon the sun burnt out and
cleansed everything, turning filth into black earth;
the wind of the desert covered it with sand and what
had once been a place of pollution was fragrant with
the fresh smell of mint and bitter wormwood.
</p>

<p>
"Seven courts&mdash;seven temples: of Tammuz of
Babylon, Attis of the Hittites, Adon of Canaan,
Adun of Crete, Mithra of Mitanni, Ashmun of
Phoenicia, Zagreus of Thrace.  All these gods are
the shadow of the One to come," Merira recalled
and again he thought drearily: "He is always
everywhere, there is no escaping from Him."
</p>

<p>
Suddenly there was a sound of footsteps.  He
looked round&mdash;there was no one.  This happened
several times.  At last, by the time Merira reached
the eighth, the secret temple, where the Holy of
Holies had been, he saw in the distance a man who
was running from moonlight into the shadow.  He
knew people were robbed and murdered in the city
at night; he remembered he had no weapons; he
stopped and wanted to shout "who goes there?" but
felt such an aversion from his own voice that he said
nothing and went into the temple.
</p>

<p>
The sixteen giant figures of Osiris in the likeness
of King Akhnaton, in royal tiaras and tightly drawn
winding sheets, had all been broken to bits.  The
ceiling had fallen in and pale moonlight fell upon the
pale blocks of alabaster&mdash;the giant limbs of the dead
giants.
</p>

<p>
Picking his way between them and climbing over
them, Merira approached the inner wall of the Holy
of Holies, where there was a figure of a Sphinx,
with a lion's body and human arms, raising to Aton
the Sun a figure of the goddess Maat, the Truth,
as a sacrificial offering.  The Sphinx had the face
of King Akhnaton; if a man had been tortured for
a thousand years in hell and then came to the earth
again, he would have such a face.
</p>

<p>
The Sphinx had not been destroyed, either because
those engaged on the task had failed to recognize the
Criminal's face or because they had not the courage
to destroy so terrible a monster.
</p>

<p>
Merira stood on a stone to see it better in the pale
moonlight.  He was looking at it eagerly and suddenly
stretched forward to it and kissed it on the
lips.
</p>

<p>
At the same moment he felt that someone was
standing behind his back: he turned round and saw
Issachar.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, it's you again!" he said, stepping off the
stone.  "Why do you follow me about?  What are
you doing here?"
</p>

<p>
"And what are you doing?" Issachar asked.
</p>

<p>
"I am waiting for him," Merira answered, with
a jeer.  "If he is alive let him come.  Does he visit
you?"
</p>

<p>
"No.  But he will come to us together: we both
wanted to kill him and we shall both see him alive."
</p>

<p>
"Are you speaking of the king?"
</p>

<p>
"Of the king and of the Son&mdash;through the king
to the Son&mdash;there is no other way for you and me."
</p>

<p>
"Why do you talk as though you were my equal?
I am an Egyptian and you are a dirty Jew.  Your
Messiah is not ours."
</p>

<p>
"He is the same for all.  You have killed Him
and we shall give Him birth."
</p>

<p>
"And kill him also? .... Well, go along,"
Merira said, and walked on, without looking round.
Issachar followed him.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly Merira stopped, looked round and said:
</p>

<p>
"Will you follow me about much longer?  Go
along, I tell you, while you have a chance."
</p>

<p>
"Don't drive me away, Merira.  If I go away He
will not come to you...."
</p>

<p>
"Do you imagine you've a charmed life, you
Jewish dog?" Merira shouted, raising his stick.
</p>

<p>
Issachar never stirred and looked into his eyes.
Merira lowered the stick and laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, you crazy creature!  What am I to do
with you?"  He paused and then said, in a changed
voice:
</p>

<p>
"Very well, come along.  Shall we go to my house?"
</p>

<p>
Issachar nodded, without speaking.
</p>

<p>
They walked quickly, as though in a hurry.  Passing
the seven sanctuary courts they came to the
street.  They never spoke and only as they drew
near Tuta's estate, Merira said:
</p>

<p>
"What time is it?"
</p>

<p>
"About seven," Issachar answered, glancing at the
sky.  The time of the night was reckoned from sunset.
</p>

<p>
"Another five hours before sunrise.  Well, there
is plenty of time," Merira said.
</p>

<p>
They walked through the garden to the summer
house.  In the hall Merira took a lamp burning in
a niche in the wall and led Issachar through several
empty chambers.  They went up the stairs, passed
Merira's bedroom and entered the room next to it.
</p>

<p>
"Lie down here," Merira said, pointing to a couch,
"I shall be next door.  Lie still, don't get up and
don't come in to me, do you hear?"
</p>

<p>
Issachar again nodded silently.
</p>

<p>
"Are you hungry?  I expect you have not tasted
food for the last day or two.  See how thin you are."
</p>

<p>
"No, I am thirsty," Issachar replied.
</p>

<p>
Merira took a jug of beer off the table and gave
it to him.  He drank greedily.
</p>

<p>
"Why do you tremble?" Merira asked, noticing
that Issachar's hands trembled so that he could hardly
hold the jug.
</p>

<p>
He threw a cloak to him.
</p>

<p>
"Lie down and wrap yourself up, perhaps you will
get warm."
</p>

<p>
"I am not sleepy, I will sit up."
</p>

<p>
"Lie down, lie down, I tell you!"
</p>

<p>
Issachar lay down on the couch.  Merira covered
him up with the cloak.
</p>

<p>
"Sleep.  I will wake you at daybreak.  We will
go to the upper temple and meet <i>Him</i> there."....
</p>

<p>
Issachar sat up suddenly and would have kissed
Merira's hand but he drew it quickly away.
</p>

<p>
He went into the next room, carefully shut the
door after him, but did not lock it; put the lamp on
a stand, took from the shelf by the wall two bleached
cedar tablets and writing a few lines upon them hid
them in his bosom.  Then he took out of the box
at the head of the bed the ring with the carbuncle,
Amon's eye, and put it on his finger.
</p>

<p>
He paced up and down the room, muttering something
under his breath, quickly and inaudibly as in
delirium.
</p>

<p>
Two chairs of honour, one for the host and
another for the visitor, stood according to Egyptian
custom on a carpeted brick platform, one step high,
in the middle of the room between four lotos-shaped,
painted and gilded columns.
</p>

<p>
Every time that Merira walked past these chairs
he slowed down his step and, without turning his
head, looked at one of them out of the corner of his
eye.  His face was sleepy and immovable and he
kept muttering to himself.
</p>

<p>
He spent more than an hour in this fashion.  The
moonlit sky through the clink-like windows with a
stone grating under the very ceiling, turned darker
and darker, and at last the grating was no longer
visible: the moon must have set.
</p>

<p>
Merira lingered by the platform longer and longer
each time.  Suddenly he stopped and smiled, looking
intently at one of the chairs.  He stepped on to the
platform, sat down in the other chair, stretched
himself and yawned.
</p>

<p>
"Forgive me, sire," he said aloud, as though
speaking to someone who sat on the chair opposite him.
"I know it is unseemly to yawn in the presence of
a king, especially of a dead one.  But I am fearfully
sleepy.  And it wouldn't be so bad if I were awake,
but this is a dream.  Does it ever happen to you?
To be asleep and yet to feel sleepy at the same time?
Issachar now wouldn't yawn in your presence.  I
confess I envied him last night.  He is shaking with
fear but he would give his soul to see you!  It is he
you ought to visit.  But evidently the dead are like
women: you only love those who don't put too much
trust in you....  By the way, I ought to have
locked the door into his room, I forgot to do it.  He
would be frightened to death if he came in, poor
fellow! .... But perhaps I left it open on purpose
so that he might come in and I should know whether
he could see you....  This is what I am driven to
in my dreariness!  It is dreary, Enra, very dreary.
Can it be as bad in your world?  Always the same
thing&mdash;rotten fish in eternity....  Or is it rather
different with you?  Is it worse or better?  You are
silent?  I don't like it when you are silent and look
at me with pity as though to say 'it's better for such
as I and worse for such as you'....  Well, aren't
you going to speak?  Tell me, what have you come
for?  Do you remember, Enra, how you said when
I wanted to kill you, 'I love you, Merira'....  And
just now who is it has said it, you or I?"
</p>

<p>
He paused as though listening to an answer and
then spoke again.
</p>

<p>
"You love your enemy?  He has taught you this?
You come from Him to try and save me?  No, Enra,
you cannot save a man who does not want to be
saved.  You died for what you loved; let me too
die for what I love&mdash;not for the world beyond the
grave but for this one, for this life&mdash;for living and
not for rotten fish.  The world already smells of
putrefaction because of Him and one day it will
stifle in its own stench.  He lies that the world kills
Him; He kills the world.  He calls Himself the Son
of God in order to kill the true Son&mdash;the world.  I
know it is hard to go against Him, but I don't care,
I don't seek for what is easy: I am the first but not
the last to rise against Him.  There will be men like
me when He comes: they will kill Him and destroy
His work; they will perish but will not save the
world; this is how it will be, Enra!"
</p>

<p>
He paused again and smiled suddenly, as he did
in the Maru-Aton garden that afternoon when
looking at Maki's birch tree he recalled Dio.
</p>

<p>
"How living you are to-day, more living than you
have ever been!  I see every fold of your dress: see
how small the pleats are: you have good pleaters in
your world.  You have the royal serpent on your
forehead; so you had renounced your crown here
and accepted it there?  I see every line in your face:
the charming, childish ones round the mouth&mdash;your
smile, Enra.  I loved it so and I love it now.  Enra,
Enra, do you know that I love you?  You have
grown younger, more beautiful.  And how is Dio?
Is she with you?  There, forgive me, I won't...
Yes, you are quite living, you could not be more so!
And yet I know that you don't exist, that you are
my dream....  Goodbye, Enra, this is the last time
I see you.  I want to escape from Him....  You
think I cannot?  He is always and everywhere and
there is no escaping from Him? ... Well, we shall
live and die and see.  There is a great deal you don't
know, Enra: you are wise like a god, but you are
not clever.  You remember, you yourself used to
say 'wisdom is beyond reason'....  Oh, I nearly
forgot: here is the ring, do you remember it?  Take
it as a keepsake....  A-ah, you laugh!  You
understand?  Yes, I want to test you: if the ring is not
on my finger when I wake, it will mean that you
exist, and if it is on my finger&mdash;you don't exist.
Well, will you take it?"
</p>

<p>
His guest stretched out his hand to him&mdash;a hand
he knew so well that he would have recognized it
among a thousand&mdash;a long, slender, beautiful hand,
with the same childishly piteous expression as the
face, with blue veins under the brown skin, so real
that warm, red blood seemed to be flowing in them.
The middle finger was slightly apart from the others
so that the ring could be slipped on more easily and
the nail on it was a dark rosy colour with a white
arch at the bottom.
</p>

<p>
"If I touch this hand I will die of horror," Merira
thought and an icy shiver ran down his back.  Yet
he did touch it, put the ring on the middle finger,
felt the firm bone under the soft flesh and he felt
no horror but only a desire to know what it was,
who it was.
</p>

<p>
He suddenly clasped the hand: it was soft, dry,
warm&mdash;a real, living hand!
</p>

<p>
"You are real!  You are real!  I adjure you by
the living God, tell me, are you real?" he cried in
such a voice as though his soul left his body with
that cry.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Regaining consciousness he saw an empty chair
in front of him and Issachar kneeling beside it.
Looking at the chair he trembled so violently that
Merira heard his teeth chattering.
</p>

<p>
"What has frightened you so?"
</p>

<p>
Issachar said nothing and went on staring at the
chair, his teeth chattering.
</p>

<p>
"He has been here," he whispered at last, turning
to Merira.
</p>

<p>
"Who?"
</p>

<p>
"King Akhnaton."
</p>

<p>
"Have you seen him?"
</p>

<p>
Issachar was going to say 'No,' but said 'Yes,' as
though somebody else had uttered the word instead
of him.  And no sooner had he said it than he
believed he had really seen the king.
</p>

<p>
"Have you heard him?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"What did he say?"
</p>

<p>
"That the Son would come to you."
</p>

<p>
"What else?"
</p>

<p>
"He spoke about the ring.  You gave him the
ring to test him."
</p>

<p>
"Did he take it?"
</p>

<p>
"He did."
</p>

<p>
"But what's this?" Merira asked, with a laugh,
pointing to the ring on his finger.  "You heard me
raving&mdash;this is all the miracle."
</p>

<p>
Issachar gazed at the ring in silence with the same
terror as he had gazed at the empty chair.  Suddenly
he raised his eyes to Merira and exclaimed:
</p>

<p>
"He has been here!  He has!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, he has.  I, too, think that Somebody has
been here," Merira answered quietly and, as it were,
thoughtfully, without a laugh.
</p>

<p>
He paused and then said, getting up:
</p>

<p>
"Let us go, it is time, the sun will soon be rising."
</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">
The sun had not yet risen but the sky
was already rosy and the morning
star shone like a tiny sun, when
Merira and Issachar climbed by the
outer staircase of Aton's temple on
to the flat roof where the great altar
of the Sun stood intact; only the disc of Aton had
been torn away and the bas-relief of King Akhnaton
on the wall broken to bits.  Aton had once been
glorified here and now a service to Amon was to be
performed at the altar and the Criminal was to be
solemnly anathematized.
</p>

<p>
Horus, with the other priests, met Merira.  All
were surprised to see Issachar, the Jew, by his side.
</p>

<p>
"Leave us," Merira said to the priests, and taking
Horus by the hand led him aside, looked into his face
and asked: "Do you love me, my son?"
</p>

<p>
"Why do you ask, father?  You know I love you."
</p>

<p>
"Do then what I ask you."
</p>

<p>
"Speak, I listen."
</p>

<p>
"Don't lay a finger on Iserker, let him go; whatever
happens, remember that he is innocent.  Release
also all those whom you have arrested.  Will you
do it?"
</p>

<p>
"I will."
</p>

<p>
"Swear it."
</p>

<p>
"May I not see the sun in eternity if I don't do it!"
</p>

<p>
"May God reward you, my son," Merira said,
embracing and kissing him.  "And now go!"
</p>

<p>
Horus glanced at Issachar and was about to ask
a question, but Merira frowned and repeated:
</p>

<p>
"Go!"
</p>

<p>
Horus was frightened, as at Maru-Aton the day
before, and obeyed as he had done then; he turned
to go without a word.  But as he descended the outer
staircase of the temple he stopped half-way so that
he could not be seen from the roof and yet see what
was happening there.  The priests stood on the first
landing below him and the soldiers still lower down.
</p>

<p>
"Can you sing the service to Aton?" Merira asked
Issachar when they were left alone.
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
They went up to the small altar at the foot of
the great one.  White alabaster dust of the broken
bas-relief of King Akhnaton crunched like snow
under their feet.
</p>

<p>
All was ready for the service: the altar was decked
with flowers and incense was burning upon it.
</p>

<p>
Merira stood before the altar with his face to the
cast, where the red ember of the sun was already
ablaze in the misty gorge of the Arabian hills.
Issachar stood facing him.
</p>

<p>
"God Aton is the only God and there is none other
God but He!" Merira intoned.
</p>

<p>
"I come to glorify thy rays, living Aton, one
eternal God!" Issachar replied.
</p>

<p>
"I declare the way of life unto you all, generations
that have been and are to be: render praise to God
Aton, the living God and ye shall live," Merira
intoned again and Issachar replied:
</p>

<p>
"Praise be to thee, living Aton, who has created
the heavens and the secrets thereof!  Thou art in
heaven and thy son, Akhnaton Uaenra, is on earth."
</p>

<p>
"Thy essence, Uaenra, is the essence of the sun,"
they both sang together, "thy flesh is the sunlight,
thy limbs the beautiful rays.  In truth thou didst
proceed from the Sun as a child from its mother's
womb.  The Sun rises in the sky and rejoices at its
son on the earth!"
</p>

<p>
The rising sun lighted the altar.  Merira raised
the libation cup and slowly, drop by drop, poured on
the burning embers the thick, blood-red wine.
</p>

<p>
"Lord!" he exclaimed in such a heart-rending
voice that Issachar began to tremble as in the night
when looking at the empty chair he saw the Invisible,
"Lord!  Before the foundations of the earth were
laid Thou didst reveal Thy will to Thy Son who is
forever.  Thou, Father, art in His heart and no one
knows Thee except Him, Thy Son!"
</p>

<p>
Then, turning his back to Issachar, he put some
fresh wine into the cup, put it on the altar table,
took the tablets from his bosom and placed them on
the table, too; taking the ring off his finger, he lifted
the carbuncle and put the poison in the cup.  He took
the cup in his hands, again turned with his face to
the sun and cried three times in a low, as it were
distant, voice:
</p>

<p>
"Glory be to the Sun, the Son Who is to come!"
</p>

<p>
Issachar fell on his knees and covered his face
with his hands: it suddenly seemed to him that
Merira saw the One Who was to come.
</p>

<p>
Merira raised the cup to his lips, drained it, and
dropping it, stretched his hands to the sun with a low
cry:
</p>

<p>
"He!  He!"
</p>

<p>
Then he fell to the ground like a man struck by
lightning.
</p>

<p>
Horus rushed to him and bending over him cried:
</p>

<p>
"Father!"
</p>

<p>
But glancing into his face he knew he was dead.
People rushed to the roof in answer to Horus's
cries and seized Issachar, thinking he was the
murderer.  But someone gave Horus the tablets.  He
read:
</p>

<p>
"I, Merira, son of Nehtaneb, high priest of Aton,
the only living God, kill myself for having wanted
to kill a righteous man.  Akhnaton Uaenra, Sun's
Joy, Sun's only Son, lives for ever!"
</p>

<p>
Horus carried out the dead man's behest and
released Issachar.  All made way for him when he
moved to go&mdash;so strange and terrible was his face.
</p>

<p>
He went to the very edge of the roof and stretching
his arms to the rising sun cried, as though he
knew that his voice would be heard at the furthest
ends of the earth:
</p>

<p>
"Thus says the Lord God of Hosts, the God of
Israel: out of Egypt shall I call my Son.  Behold I
will send my Messenger and the Lord whom you seek
and the Messenger of the covenant you delight in
shall suddenly come to His temple.  Behold, He
cometh!"
